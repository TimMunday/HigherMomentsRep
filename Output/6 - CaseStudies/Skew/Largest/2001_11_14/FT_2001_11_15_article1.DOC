\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Britain has only a one in 10 chance of suffering a recession, Mervyn King, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England's deputy governor for monetary policy, said yesterday - bringing expectations of future interest rate cuts down sharply. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0      He said: "The important big picture is that the UK has withstood the slowdown that hit the rest of the world economy. Of course we have been affected but that's been less marked in the UK than elsewhere."  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr King's sunny outlook crowned yesterday's quarterly inflation report from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate-setting monetary policy committee - which suggested Britain is likely to enjoy steady growth over the next two years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Interest rate-watchers responded sharply to the report's main forecast for inflation two years out - the time when any interest rate change now exerts its maximum effect on inflation. It suggested for the first time in more than a year that underlying inflation was more likely to end the period above the government's 2.5 per cent target than below it - although the probabilities were finely balanced at 51 per cent to 49 per cent. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deputy governor explained that the risks to inflation two years ahead were on the upside because of the risk that sterling might fall. The report estimates a 13 per cent chance that inflation will be above 3.5 per cent in two years' time if interest rates remain unchanged, triggering a letter from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  governor to the chancellor explaining why inflation has risen so far above target and what he will do about it. Britain's persistent balance of payments deficit has reinforced claims that the pound's strength is unsustainable. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report was imbued with the committee's new-found attitude that unbalanced growth, based on enthusiastic consumer spending, is better than no growth at all. The committee noted that the contrast between the internationally exposed and domestic parts of the economy "remains as marked as ever". But it justified its half-point rate cut last week, saying "the more subdued global outlook had weakened the outlook for growth and lowered prospective inflationary pressures". 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most economists agreed it was unlikely but possible Britain would slip into recession - defined by Mr King as negative growth over a year. Simon Rubinsohn of Gerrard, the fund manager, said: "If we do have a recession it will be because of consumers, but as long as unemployment doesn't grow dramatically they won't throw in the towel." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr King said the committee's central projection "implies a slowing in growth over the next few quarters, reflecting the weak outlook for the world economy in the short term, before picking up to around trend in the second year of the forecast horizon". 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Underlying inflation was forecast to fall in the short term. "It is then expected to remain broadly flat before picking up . . . at the end of the forecast horizon." Editorial Comment, Page 22
