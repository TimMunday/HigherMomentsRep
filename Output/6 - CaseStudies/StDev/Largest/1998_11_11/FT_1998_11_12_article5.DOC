\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sterling rebounded from earlier jitters over the state of the UK economy yesterday after the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England's Inflation Report reduced hopes of rapid cuts in interest rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The pound, having fallen in advance of the report, recovered sharply to finish London trading hours at DM2.788, down from DM2.799 at Tuesday's close.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warned that international developments during the past three months had reduced the prospects for growth through a decline in world trade, it said the chances of a credit crunch affecting the UK were low.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And the central case in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  projection for output growth showed it recovering to trend in 2000 after slipping to about 1 per cent in 1999. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The Inflation Report also pushed down short sterling prices across the strip, as market participants revised up their expectations for the future path of interest rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A fall of 12.5 basis points in the December 1998 contract implied a virtually unanimous market view that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) would not cut interest rates at its meeting in December. And prices of contracts expiring in 1999 showed similar falls.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report itself gave some indication that the MPC did not share the financial markets' view of potential inflationary pressure within the economy and hence the future path of interest rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The central projection for RPIX inflation based on the market's expectations of interest rates showed inflation consistently above the 2.5 per cent target, implying that rates may stay higher than the market thought.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Inflation Report also said that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  view of the likely path for sterling in the future had less downside risk than previous reports had assumed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The market's residual expectation of sterling joining European monetary union (EMU) in 2002 at a rate of about DM2.60-DM2.70 should also hold the currency up, said Avinash Persaud of JP Morgan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sterling yesterday was trading close to DM2.50 in the 2002 forward market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Traders in the UK often like to be bearish about their own currency," Mr Avinash said, "but if the perception grows that the UK will join the euro, the market will be quick to make convergence trades."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 EMU expectations would be an "anchor for sterling" and make it harder for the currency to fall, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The dollar yesterday gave up some more of the gains it had made against the yen earlier in the week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Profit-takers took advantage of thin trading on a public holiday in the US, and the currency ended European trading at Y121.8 versus the yen, down from Y122.5 on Tuesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The dollar was a bit directionless on the day," said Michael Wallace, manager of currency analysis at economic consultancy Standard and Poor's MMS.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It had got a bit ahead of itself earlier in the week and today it pulled back somewhat, he added."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The yen's rise versus the dollar again helped the emerging market Asian currencies, which are nonetheless struggling to shake off their image as being no more than satellites of the Japanese currency.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Taiwanese central \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cut two key intervention rates by 12.5 basis points yesterday. Market analysts said that the cut was not unexpected and may have been an attempt to inject confidence into the local equity market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Taiwanese dollar ended London trading hours yesterday higher against the dollar at T$ 32.6865.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The firmer yen trend in Asian trading has definitely helped the Asian currencies," said Tim Fox, chief treasury economist at Standard Chartered in London. "But in general there is a more selective attitude to Asia," he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is notable that even when there is a general downward movement in the east Asian currencies, good performers like the Philippine peso and the Thai baht have managed to hold on to most of their gains," said Mr Fox.
