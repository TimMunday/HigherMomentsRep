\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England has done Gordon Brown proud. This is not because it has repeated the chancellor's forecasts. Both its mandate and approach preclude that. But, as Mervyn King, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deputy governor for monetary policy, said yesterday, the two forecasts are at least "broadly in the same territory". Indeed they are - and rightly so. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Much the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  most important contribution to debate has been its emphasis on forecasting uncertainty. The "fan charts" it uses are annoyingly imprecise to those accustomed to fraudulent accuracy. But it is this very lack of precision that makes them truthful. Given this uncertainty, what matters most is responding swiftly and with determination to events, as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has done with the two cuts in interest rates since the last inflation report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those cuts were a reaction to news since last August. As it has to, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believes the most likely outcome for inflation two years hence is to hit the target, at current interest rates. To achieve this, the most likely low point for 12-month economic growth is, says the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  around 1 per cent. But there is also a one in four chance of a recession.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Is this story plausible? And can the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  make something like this happen?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The answer to the first question is yes. One of the reasons for the gloom evident in confidence surveys and press commentary is that people have forgotten (or are too young to remember) what a normal cycle is like. Since 1948, the UK has suffered just three prolonged periods of negative 12-month growth: in 1974-75, 1980-81 and again in 1990-92. All resulted from inflationary overheating. Between 1958 and 1974, there was not one quarter of negative 12-month growth. That is what should happen with stable and low inflation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The answer to the second question is again yes, but only up to a point. Because inflation is low and likely to remain so, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is able to lower rates sharply, should it be necessary to do so. Such action could come too late to halt recession. But there is no reason to expect the monetary policy committee's reaction to any threatened undershoot of the inflation target to be weak. If that risk were to materialise, it could readily promote a still stronger recovery, by cutting rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most important question then is not what happens over the next year, particularly since it is probably too late to alter the outcome. The fundamental issue is, instead, how high unemployment needs to remain to stabilise inflation. The best reason for optimism is that the labour market is working quite well. The government must ensure it continues to do so.
