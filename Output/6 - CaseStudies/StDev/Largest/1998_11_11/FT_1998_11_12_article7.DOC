\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 European bonds ended mixed yesterday as a holiday in the US reduced trade.  The only significant action was in the UK, where a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England report playing down prospects of a further interest rate cut sliced half a point off the benchmark gilt future.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Investors were mostly sidelined and trading was in narrow ranges. In Germany, bunds largely ignored an auction of five-year Bobls and the December 10-year bund future traded in a range of 112.13-112.32. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In UK gilts, interest rate expectations were skewed after the BoE's monetary policy committee said in its quarterly inflation report that underlying inflation would rise above its target next year, then return to 2.5 per cent in two years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That prompted the short sterling market to scale back its interest rate cut expectations by 10-12 basis points across all contracts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The December short sterling future, which indicates where the market expects key rates to be that month, was pricing in a rate of 6.77 per cent by December, against a rate of 6.64 per cent at the previous day's close.  The key interest rate is 6.75 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The December 10-year gilt future settled 0.50 lower at 114.37 in volume of 35,000 contracts traded. The spread between the cash gilt and bund contracts widened by 5 basis points to 92 points, after having fallen to a low for the day of 82 points.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That dip was partly the result of data showing unemployment had risen by 6,800 in October, contrary to expectations of a fall.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Smith Barney, said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  view on inflation was too pessimistic. "I think that growth will be slow enough that you'll get more of a profit squeeze than they expect and less of the wage pressures will be passed through to inflation," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also forecast that economic growth would slow to about 1 per cent next year before climbing back later.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 James Mitchell, senior strategist at Nomura, said: "In the near term, gilts are likely to remain a bit nervous but come next month, when we get the next batch of [economic] survey data, people will become more optimistic on rate hopes."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In German bunds, the December 10-year future was unchanged at 112.21 in dull late trading. The main focus was a speech by Franz-Christoph Zeitier, a Bundesbank council member, in which he said the economic outlook did not warrant a rate cut this year or next.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Traders said there was not much demand for the Bobl auction. The government said it had sold DM7bn of the notes priced at 99.94 and higher. The average yield was 3.75 per cent.
