\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mervyn King, the deputy governor of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England responsible for monetary policy, could hardly be accused of understatement yesterday when he described the past three months as "unusually interesting".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Introducing the latest Inflation Report, he noted that the outlook for world economic growth had deteriorated significantly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the domestic front, business and consumer confidence had fallen sharply and the value of stock market investments had fallen 5 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In response the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 7.25 per cent in October and by a further half a percentage point to 6.75 per cent this month. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, judging from short-sterling futures contracts, investors had thought rates would fall further, to a low of 6 per cent or less.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Inflation Report prompted significant falls in short-sterling contracts. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said rate cuts in line with market expectations would keep inflation above the 2.5 per cent target throughout the next two years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the fourth quarter of 2000 inflation would be 2.75 per cent and rising.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  now believes it has done enough to deliver 2.5 per cent inflation in two years. In contrast to the Treasury's pre-Budget report forecast, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  predicts inflation will rise temporarily as the minimum wage helps to nudge earnings growth higher.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Comparing the views of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Treasury on growth and inflation is not easy because the two institutions express their forecasts in different ways and incorporate different assumptions about the path of interest rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Treasury expresses its growth forecast as an average expected outcome - 1 per cent next year and 2.25 per cent in 2000 - with a half-point "opportunity range" on top.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This comes into play only if labour market reforms or pay restraint allow the economy to grow quicker without adding inflationary pressure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  growth forecast is presented as a "fan-chart"; in effect a contour map showing the probability that growth will fall within particular ranges. But the contour map is centred on the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  modal prediction - the single most likely outcome - rather than the average expected outcome.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This distinction can be important when, as in yesterday's Inflation Report, the uncertainties surrounding the growth forecast are skewed to the downside.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In these circumstances the average expected outcome is lower than the single most likely expected outcome and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  growth forecast is weaker than it looks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Michael Saunders, at Salomon Smith Barney, estimates that, expressed as an average, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  growth forecast for 1999 is around 0.75 per cent, slightly lower than the Treasury's 1 per cent. According to Kevin Darlington at ABN-Amro, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is then pencilling in 1.75 per cent growth for 2000, a less rapid rebound than the 2.25 per cent forecast by the Treasury.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr King said there was a one-in-four chance output in the middle of next year would be down on a year earlier - twice the probability given in the August inflation report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Saunders said this implied a one-in-two or three chance of a recession with output falling in two successive quarters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Given the uncertainties and average errors that surround any forecast, it is important to keep the difference between the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Treasury predictions in perspective.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The big picture is that the two forecasts are broadly in the same territory," Mr King said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The other key factor is that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Treasury base their forecasts on different interest rate (and exchange rate) assumptions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  assumes that interest rates are unchanged, while the Treasury assumes an unpublished interest rate profile it believes to be consistent with delivering the inflation target in two years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Treasury presumably believes interest rates could be cut further, ensuring a relatively modest slowdown and a rapid rebound in growth without endangering the inflation target.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  thinks there is less scope to cut rates without endangering the inflation target and, as a result, that growth may be somewhat weaker than the Treasury expects.
