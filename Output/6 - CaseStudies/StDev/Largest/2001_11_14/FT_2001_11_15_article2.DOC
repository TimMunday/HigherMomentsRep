\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0      Day by day, the outlook for the global economy becomesbleaker. A recession is a racing certainty in the US once data for the end of this year are released. Japan, the second biggest economy, risks deteriorating from recession to slump. And Germany, the third largest, is flirting with negative rates of economic growth. Yet the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England is forecasting relatively smooth waters for growth in the UK economy.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Presenting the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  latest inflation report, Mervyn King, its deputy governor, put the chances of recession at only one in 10. The most likely scenario, he explained, was that the annual rate of growth next year would slip only a little below the UK's long-term average of 2 1/4 per cent. The rise in unemployment on both official measures received only the most cursory of comments in Mr King's text. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is right not to be seriously alarmed by the end of continuously falling unemployment. No country can be immune from the global downturn, particularly not the UK where exports account for a quarter of gross domestic product but public spending and consumer demand are taking up the slack. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fortuitously, the government's spending spree is now on tap. This cash injection seemed ill-timed when announced last year but now it is providing relief. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And, so far, there have been few signs of a slowdown in consumer spending. Retail sales volumes rose by 1 1/2 per cent in the third quarter and lending to individuals is at a 10-year high. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  monetary policy strategy has been to replace lower-than-expected exports with continued consumption growth. Gone is its inhibition about increasing economic imbalances. Despite buoyant spending, inflationary pressures have been extremely subdued, so the monetary policy committee has cut interest rates by a full percentage point since September 11. The message to consumers is: "Spend, spend, spend - at least until the world economy recovers." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For all this optimism, there are two contradictory risks, both of which threaten to blow apart Gordon Brown's "no more boom and bust" promise. Neither is predictable, so no appropriate monetary policy response exists. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong consumer spending coupled with the persistently high value of sterling has resulted in a rising current account deficit. Import growth has exceeded that of exports for the past five years. It cannot continue indefinitely. No one can predict when, but, if these circumstances persist, at some point sterling will fall. Import prices would rise and domestic demand would be boosted. A rapid tightening of monetary policy would be required but it could be too late to offset a spike in inflation. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alternatively, increased caution among consumers might prompt households to raise their savings rates and rebuild their fragile balance sheet positions. Consumer spending would be hit hard and the appropriate monetary policy easing would be too late to have a quick impact. The longer the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  relies on consumer spending to avoid a recession, the more acute this risk is. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is caught between these two risks. Policymaking is rarely this difficult. But with economic growth remaining close to trend and inflation near its target, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  judgment thus far is hard to fault.
