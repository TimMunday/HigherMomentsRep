\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Inflation is set to remain below target over the next two years, but with a higher risk that it could overshoot because of a fall in sterling, said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England yesterday. Its projection showed the most likely outcome for inflation would be below the 2.5 per cent target over the next two years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0      However the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  report follows Tuesday's high inflation figures, which the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  monetary policy committee did not have time to incorporate in its forecast.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mervyn King, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deputy governor, admitted that the sharp rise in inflation in January from 1.9 to 2.6 per cent had been a surprise, with the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expecting a rise only half as big, and the committee would need to evaluate the rest over the next month. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He insisted the projection did not mean that the committee had given up trying to hit the target, saying there was more chance that inflation would overshoot rather than undershoot the target. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report showed a 57 per cent chance that inflation would be above the target in two years' time compared with a 51 per cent chance in the previous forecast in November. The risk of a fall in sterling pushing up import prices, because of the current account deficit or a broad-based recovery in the euro, was one of the main reasons for this increased risk. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Independent economists said the report showed the committee was "treading water", and that it had not solved the question of how to curb gently the surging growth in consumer demand at a time when most inflationary indicators were weak. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report said that consumption growth should slow, but the fall in unemployment yesterday and recent recoveries in consumer confidence have cast doubt on whether households will stop spending of their own accord. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The MPC seems to be signalling the beginning of a bias towards raising rates, but has not yet come round to the conclusion that they should start," said Danny Gabay, UK economist at JP Morgan in London. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For nine successive quarters they have said that consumption will slow, but without higher rates the mechanism for households doing so remains unclear. The MPC has still to find a way to persuade consumers to climb down the cliff rather than jumping off the edge," he added. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr King, who has ex-pressed his own concern at the strength of consumer demand and the build-up of debt, said it was unclear if or when the long-awaited retrenchment of household spending would arrive. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report's forecast for growth was similar to that three months ago, with annual growth slowing a little more quickly to below 1.5 per cent at the end of the year before picking up more strongly in subsequent years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was cautiously optimistic about a pick-up in the global economy, with better news from the US offsetting more disappointing prospects from the eurozone. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report noted the risk that a sharp reduction in consumer spending could be accompanied by a fall in asset prices and sterling - which would probably re-duce growth and increase inflation at the same time. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr King could not say whether the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would probably raise or cut interest rates in response if that happened. Editorial Comment, Page 18 www.bankofengland.co.uk
