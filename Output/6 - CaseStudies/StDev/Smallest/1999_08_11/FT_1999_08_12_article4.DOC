\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The spectre of an overheating labour market re-emerged yesterday as official data showed average earnings growing faster than most analysts had expected.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Office for National Statistics said average earnings had grown by 5.2 per cent in the year to June, taking the headline three-month average rate to 4.4 per cent. Financial market economists had expected a headline rate of 4.1 per cent. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ONS said pay awards in the public sector, together with large bonuses paid by private sector telecommunications companies, had helped to push the headline figure higher.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Public sector pay awards have generally been paid in a block this year rather than staggered over time as some were in previous years, which has driven up the annual growth rate. But the large contribution from private sector bonus payments was a surprise, since the traditional spring bonus round ended some months ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, unemployment continued to fall, raising the prospect that a tight labour market would re-emerge as a source of inflationary pressure. The number of claimant unemployed - those without a job and claiming benefit - fell by 32,900 in July, the largest monthly fall since November 1997, and nearly three times larger than the average monthly decrease over the past six months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the government's preferred survey-based measure, unemployment fell by 62,000 in the period April-June on the previous three months. Although the number of those economically inactive - neither working nor unemployed and looking for work - also rose, employment continued to grow. The numbers of people employed rose by 43,000 in the period April to June to a record 27,394,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David Blunkett, secretary of state for education and employment, attacked economists who had said unemployment would rise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Last year, doom and gloom merchants predicted a rise in unemployment of half a million. In fact, since last year employment has grown by 347,000. The doom and gloom merchants got it wrong," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said he aimed to get unemployment down to the levels of the "initial post-war period". Claimant count unemployment averaged less than 2 per cent in the decade after 1945, compared with 4.3 per cent now.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But financial market economists, the target of Mr Blunkett's ire, said yesterday that the rise in average earnings suggested falling unemployment was pushing up wages.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Real earnings have not slowed down, and pay awards have yet to respond to the lower inflation of the latest few months," said Dharshini David, UK economist at HSBC investment \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 bank.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0
