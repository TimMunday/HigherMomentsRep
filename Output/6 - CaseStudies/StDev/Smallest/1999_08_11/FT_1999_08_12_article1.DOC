\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Has the British economy imported the secret of eternal youth from the US? The ability to grow perpetually without debilitating inflation or labour market sclerosis seems almost to be within its grasp. Almost.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latest labour market figures yesterday showed that jobs are still being created while the headline unemployment fell again in July to the lowest for nearly two decades.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England's monetary policy committee said in its latest Inflation Report that output had grown faster than it expected three months ago, with inflation more subdued. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even better, it forecasts that growth will accelerate steadily but moderately to reach an annual rate of about 3 per cent by 2001, while the inflation rate remains well below the government's 2 1/2 per cent target for most of the period - although on a rising trend in 2001.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Is this too good to be true? Not necessarily. The US economy has continually defied predictions that over-rapid growth would collapse in an inflationary splurge. Instead, growth has slowed to the respectable walking pace of an annual 2.3 per cent in the second quarter with inflation at only 2 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The extent to which the British economy has acquired a similar resilience was the subject of lively discussion in the MPC. The committee accepted that the tendency for a tight labour market to spill over into higher pay has changed for the better.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although members differed on the extent of this improvement, it does suggest that the UK economy can be permitted to enjoy a faster growth for a longer period before the authorities have to apply the precautionary brakes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This might imply that the next rise in official interest rates could be deferred. But, as the US Federal Reserve signalled with its quarter point rate rise to 5 per cent on June 30, improved performance does not repeal the laws of economics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As an economy moves towards full capacity - nobody can be sure at what level of unemployment - growth must decelerate if inflation is to be controlled. In the US, the economy may be slowing of its own accord. But in Britain, growth is picking up quite fast after a flat six months from October to March. And the rise in UK average earnings in June provides a warning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The financial markets are now discounting a rise in UK interest rates to about 7 per cent in two years. If rates \b0 \i \ul0 were\b0 \i0 \ul0  raised to this extent, economic growth would be depressed, from 3 per cent to 2.7 per cent in 2001, according to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  projections.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Clearly it would be better if the economy could find the elixir of non-inflationary growth, without the need for official restraint. But the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cannot bet on this, and it must stand ready to raise.
