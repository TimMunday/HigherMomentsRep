\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of England has admitted it will be flying in misty conditions over the next few years due to uncertainties over trade figures and the changeover to a new measure of inflation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Presenting the monetary policy committee's quarterly inflation report, Mervyn King, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  governor, acknowledged that there was "enormous uncertainty about the trade position".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The fog of war has been replaced by the mist of the trade statistics," he said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His comments come after the revelation last month that Britain's trade deficit has been about 1 per cent of gross domestic product larger than previously calculated. A Europe-wide scam involving mobile phones and computer parts led to billions of pounds of imports going missing from official data in the past four years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a result, imbalances in the UK economy have been greater than previously thought - with consumer spending even more robust than hitherto supposed. Any adjustment in spending by consumers may therefore be more painful. Mr King indicated that the uncertainty for the MPC would also be heightened by the replacement of RPIX as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  target measure of inflation by the harmonised index of consumer prices - which takes over in November.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While arguing that the new measure was technically superior to the outgoing RPIX, Mr King said the shift would be a challenge to present to the public. In addition, there was uncertainty at the possible inclusion of a housing element in the HICP index - which does not reflect housing costs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The inflation report overall had a more dovish tone than had been expected by the City. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  came in for some criticism when a quarter-point rate cut in July was followed by figures showing a record rise in consumer borrowing. This led some to suspect that the August report would stress the dangers of further monetary easing. In fact there was no indication that further rate cuts were unlikely.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Bank\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is forecasting the economy to recover slightly slower than predicted in the last inflation report in May. The projection for growth this year was scaled back from about 2.25 per cent to closer to 1.75 per cent. But the growth expectation for next year revised up from around 2.5 per cent to about 2.75 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The profile for inflation was also lowered and is expected to spend most of the next two years under the target. Financial markets scaled back expectations that rates would rise again around the end of the year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This reduces the chances that there will be any action to reverse the monetary easing seen in July," said Ray Attrill, director of research at the economic consultancy 4Cast. "The clear message was that the downside risks to growth were still greater than the upside risks." Lex, Page 18 www.ft.com/rates
