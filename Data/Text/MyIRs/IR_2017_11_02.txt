Inflation Report
November 2017
In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.
Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy,
including its objectives for growth and employment.
The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of
the Monetary Policy Committee. It serves two purposes. First, its preparation provides a
comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid
to our decision-making. Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the
reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect.
Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are
based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths
for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central
projections.
This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with
section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Monetary Policy Summary i
Monetary Policy Summary
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the
2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its
meeting ending on 1 November 2017, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to increase
Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%. The Committee voted unanimously to
maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion. The Committee also voted
unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the
issuance of central bank reserves, at £435 billion.
The MPC’s outlook for inflation and activity in the November Inflation Report is broadly similar to its projections in
August. In the MPC’s central forecast, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market
yields, GDP grows modestly over the next few years at a pace just above its reduced rate of potential. Consumption
growth remains sluggish in the near term before rising, in line with household incomes. Net trade is bolstered by the
strong global expansion and the past depreciation of sterling. Business investment is being affected by uncertainties
around Brexit, but it continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by strong global demand, high rates of
profitability, the low cost of capital and limited spare capacity.
CPI inflation rose to 3.0% in September. The MPC still expects inflation to peak above 3.0% in October, as the past
depreciation of sterling and recent increases in energy prices continue to pass through to consumer prices. The effects of
rising import prices on inflation diminish over the next few years, and domestic inflationary pressures gradually pick up as
spare capacity is absorbed and wage growth recovers. On balance, inflation is expected to fall back over the next year
and, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, to approach the 2% target by
the end of the forecast period.
As in previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the
United Kingdom’s eventual trading relationship with the European Union. The projections also assume that, in the
interim, households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading
relationship.
The decision to leave the European Union is having a noticeable impact on the economic outlook. The overshoot of
inflation throughout the forecast predominantly reflects the effects on import prices of the referendum-related fall in
sterling. Uncertainties associated with Brexit are weighing on domestic activity, which has slowed even as global growth
has risen significantly. And Brexit-related constraints on investment and labour supply appear to be reinforcing the
marked slowdown that has been increasingly evident in recent years in the rate at which the economy can grow without
generating inflationary pressures.
Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new
international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over
the next few years. It can, however, support the economy during the adjustment process. The MPC’s remit specifies
that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it
intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. 
ii Inflation Report November 2017
The steady erosion of slack has reduced the degree to which it is appropriate for the MPC to accommodate an extended
period of inflation above the target. Unemployment has fallen to a 42-year low and the MPC judges that the level of
remaining slack is limited. The global economy is growing strongly, domestic financial conditions are highly
accommodative and consumer confidence has remained resilient. In line with the framework set out at the time of the
referendum, the MPC now judges it appropriate to tighten modestly the stance of monetary policy in order to return
inflation sustainably to the target. Accordingly, the Committee voted by 7–2 to raise Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage
points, to 0.5%. Monetary policy continues to provide significant support to jobs and activity in the current exceptional
circumstances. All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and
to a limited extent.
There remain considerable risks to the outlook, which include the response of households, businesses and financial
markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The MPC will respond to developments as they occur
insofar as they affect the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation. The Committee will
monitor closely the incoming evidence on these and other developments, including the impact of today’s increase in
Bank Rate, and stands ready to respond to changes in the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return
of inflation to the 2% target.
Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 1
1 Global economic and financial
market developments
The broad‑based momentum in global growth has continued, and the outlook for the euro area in
particular has strengthened. As growth has recovered, spare capacity in many countries is being
absorbed. That strength has supported the prices of risky assets. Sterling remains significantly
below its level prior to the EU referendum.
Global GDP growth has been steadily picking up over the past
year and has been significantly stronger than projected in
August 2016 (Chart 1.1). Growth in the G7, excluding the
United Kingdom, strengthened further in Q2 broadly as
projected three months ago (Section 1.1). A number of
indicators point to a continuation of this strength in the near
term. Survey indicators of output and new orders remain
robust. Measures of business and consumer confidence
(Chart 1.2) are also healthy, particularly in the euro area and
United States. Part of the pickup in global growth can be
accounted for by a recovery in investment growth. Capital
goods orders have increased sharply (Chart 1.3). This should,
in turn, support growth in the capital stock — the resources
and equipment available to workers to produce output — and
hence the outlook for activity further ahead.
The improvement in global growth and confidence since
early 2016 has been an important factor supporting risky asset
prices and financial conditions in many countries.
Notwithstanding the firmer global backdrop, UK growth was
modest in 2017 H1 (Chart 1.1 and Section 3) and market
contacts report that investors remain cautious about the
United Kingdom’s relative growth prospects. While volatile,
since the EU referendum the sterling ERI has remained
15%–20% below its late‑2015 peak. In addition, the equity
prices of UK‑focused companies have underperformed their
more globally orientated peers (Section 1.2).
1.1 Global economic developments
The euro area
Quarterly euro‑area GDP growth was 0.6% in Q3 (Table 1.A),
having strengthened in recent quarters (Chart 1.4). That
pickup in growth has become increasingly broad‑based across
countries. Growth appears to have been supported by
improving business and consumer confidence (Chart 1.2),
alongside accommodative monetary policy and easing credit
conditions. GDP growth is projected to remain a little
above ½% in the near term, slightly stronger than projected
three months ago and consistent with business survey

indicators of activity, such as the IHS Markit purchasing
managers’ indices, which have remained around recent highs.
The recovery in demand has led to some slack in the labour
market being absorbed. Euro‑area unemployment was
8.9% in September, down from 9.9% a year earlier — although
the extent of the fall in unemployment has varied across
countries (Chart 1.5). With the recent pace of growth likely to
be maintained, unemployment is projected to fall further.
Despite the fall in unemployment over the past year, wage
growth has picked up only modestly. That may, in part, reflect
the fact that measures of underemployment — which include
people wanting to work more hours and those discouraged
from searching for work — suggest that there is still some
slack remaining in the labour market. It may also reflect a fall
in recent years in the rate of unemployment consistent with
stable wage and price pressures — the equilibrium
unemployment rate. Long‑term unemployment has fallen,
although it remains above pre‑crisis levels. The extensive
labour market reforms implemented after the crisis in some
countries, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain, are likely to
have contributed to a decline in the equilibrium rate of
unemployment as well. And labour market reforms recently
proposed in France may help to lower structural
unemployment somewhat further. The MPC judges that there
is likely to be somewhat more slack in the euro area than
previously assumed, and the projection for activity growth is
therefore somewhat stronger than in August (Section 5).
Euro‑area core inflation — which excludes the effects of
energy and food prices — was 0.9% in October, below its
historical average of 1.6% (Table 1.B). Headline inflation was
1.4% in October. Having pulled down headline inflation for
much of 2015 and 2016, energy prices made a small positive
contribution.
The United States
Quarterly US GDP growth has been broadly stable in recent
years, averaging around ½% (Table 1.A). In recent quarters,
more of that growth has been accounted for by business
investment than over 2016. Growth in Q3 was 0.7%, stronger
than had been projected three months ago. And growth is
projected to remain at around those rates in the near term
(Table 1.C).
Indicators suggest that there is probably little spare capacity
remaining in the US economy. A variety of measures of labour
market slack — including the unemployment rate,
underemployment and the rate at which employees are
voluntarily leaving jobs — are around, or approaching, their
pre‑crisis lows. That means that the pace at which activity can
grow without putting upward pressure on inflation will be
increasingly dependent on the pace of productivity growth.
Having been weak in recent years, there are signs that labour

productivity growth has begun to pick up. Four‑quarter hourly
productivity in the non‑farm business sector grew by 1.3% in
Q2, compared with a fall of 0.4% a year earlier, although
growth remains well below pre‑crisis rates. Productivity
growth should be supported by the recent rise in business
investment, which will support growth in the capital stock.
Despite the narrowing in slack, wage growth and inflation have
remained subdued in the United States. For example, growth
in the Employment Cost Index measure of wages was 2.5%
over the four quarters to 2017 Q3, up from around 2% in
2014–15. The headline inflation rate was 1.6% in September,
and core inflation — excluding food and energy — was 1.3%,
both around 0.5 percentage points below their historical
averages (Table 1.B).
Emerging market economies
In China, GDP growth has been stable over the past two years
(Table 1.A). In Q3, four‑quarter headline GDP growth was
6.8%, down slightly from 6.9% in Q2. While the authorities
have taken some measures to reduce financial sector
leverage, and macroprudential policy measures have resulted
in slowing house price inflation, activity growth has continued
to be accompanied by rapid rises in credit. Annual total social
financing growth has averaged around 13% over the past
two years, and the outstanding stock of credit to the
non‑financial sector reached 258% of GDP in 2017 Q1. There
remain challenges for the authorities in maintaining current
rates of GDP growth while reducing risks to financial
stability.(1)
Growth in other emerging market economies (EMEs) has
continued to recover over the past year, supported by: easier
domestic financial conditions; the recovery in
advanced‑economy demand and world trade growth; and, for
commodity exporters, the recovery in commodity prices since
early 2016. Growth is projected to remain robust,
notwithstanding some easing of monthly surveys of activity in
2017 Q3.
1.2 Developments in financial markets
The improvement in global growth and confidence has been
an important factor supporting risky asset prices and financial
conditions. Market interest rates in the United States and
euro area have risen relative to 18 months ago, although they
remain low by historical standards and market‑implied paths
continue to suggest that policy rates will rise only gradually in
coming years. Heightened geopolitical tensions over the past
few months do not appear to have had a significant effect on
investor sentiment. Financial market‑based measures of

investor uncertainty and sentiment — such as implied
volatilities — have remained at historically low levels.
Interest rates
At its September meeting, the MPC voted 7–2 to leave interest
rates unchanged, and unanimously to maintain the stock of
purchased assets (see the box on page 5). The Minutes of the
meeting stated that, conditional on the economy evolving in
such a way that slack continues to be eroded and underlying
inflationary pressure rises, the majority of the MPC considered
some withdrawal of monetary stimulus to be appropriate in
coming months. Around the time of the announcement,
market interest rates rose. In the run‑up to the
November Report, the market‑implied path for Bank Rate
reached 1% in three years’ time, around 0.2 percentage points
higher than at the time of the August Report (Chart 1.6). The
details of the November decision are contained in the
Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and in
more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.
In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) has made no changes to its target range for the
federal funds rate of 1% to 1¼% since the August Report. But
it announced that it would begin to reduce the size of the
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. During 2008–14, the balance
sheet grew from around US$800 billion to around
US$4.2 trillion in order to support the economy, largely
through the purchase of government debt and
mortgage‑backed securities. The FOMC had maintained this
stock by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets. From
October onwards, however, a proportion of maturing assets
will not be replaced — initially at the rate of up to
US$10 billion per month, increasing to US$50 billion per
month over the course of a year. As a consequence, the
balance sheet will gradually shrink. The announcement had
been widely anticipated by market contacts and appeared to
have little effect on market interest rates. In the run‑up to the
November Report, the implied path for policy rates was
slightly steeper than in August, having risen following
stronger‑than‑expected economic data releases (Chart 1.6).
The European Central Bank (ECB) has made no changes to its
policy rates since August. In October, however, it announced
that, while it would continue its asset purchase programme
until at least September 2018, it would reduce the pace of
purchases from €60 billion to €30 billion per month from the
beginning of 2018. There was limited market reaction to the
announcement, suggesting that it was broadly in line with
investors’ expectations. In the run‑up to the
November Report, the market‑implied path for policy rates
was slightly flatter than in August (Chart 1.6).
Longer‑term interest rates have changed little since the
August Report (Chart 1.7), although they remain higher than
18 months ago in the United States and euro area. Some of

Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 5
that increase reflects a recovery in inflation compensation
(Chart 1.8), which in turn will reflect inflation expectations
and the perceptions of risks around the outlook for inflation.
Inflation compensation in the euro area and United States
drifted lower from mid‑2014, following the decline in global
commodity prices and heightened concerns about the
long‑term outlook for global activity growth. Inflation
compensation has since recovered, and is around its past
average rate in the United Kingdom, although it remains
somewhat below average in the United States and euro area.
Despite being higher than 18 months ago, long‑term interest
rates remain historically low. That probably reflects
slow‑moving structural factors, such as demographics, which
are likely to continue to weigh on global interest rates for
some time to come.(1) Consistent with this, market‑implied
paths continue to suggest that policy rates will rise only
gradually in coming years (Chart 1.6), particularly in
comparison to previous tightening cycles.(2)
Monetary policy since the August Report
The MPC’s central projection in the August Report was for
sluggish GDP growth in the near term as the squeeze on
households’ real incomes weighed on consumption. Growth
was then judged likely to pick up to just above its modest
potential rate over the rest of the forecast period, supported
by firming net trade and business investment and by a modest
recovery in consumption growth. Inflation was projected to
rise further above the target in the second half of 2017 as the
pass‑through of sterling’s depreciation continued. Conditional
on the path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates
prevailing at the time, inflation was projected to remain above
the target throughout the forecast period. That central
projection was also conditioned on the stocks of purchased
gilts and corporate bonds remaining at £435 billion and
£10 billion respectively.
At its meeting ending on 13 September 2017, the MPC noted
that the relatively limited news on activity pointed, if
anything, to a slightly stronger picture than anticipated.
Employment growth had been resilient and, as a result, the
unemployment rate had fallen to 4.3%. In addition, weak
productivity growth had corroborated the MPC’s forecast for
modest potential supply growth. Overall, the latest indicators
had been consistent with UK demand growth a little in excess
of this diminished rate of potential supply growth, and pointed
to the continued erosion of the remaining limited degree of
spare capacity in the economy.
CPI inflation had risen to 2.9% in August, which was slightly
higher than the MPC had anticipated at the time of the
August Report. Developments in the oil market suggested
greater near‑term upward pressure on inflation from petrol
prices, and CPI inflation was expected to rise above 3% in
October.
All MPC members continued to judge that monetary policy
could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent than
the yield curve underpinning the August projections implied if
the economy followed a path broadly consistent with those
projections. In addition, a majority of Committee members
judged that, if slack continued to be eroded and underlying
inflationary pressure continued to gradually build in line with
the August projections, then some withdrawal of monetary
stimulus would be likely to be appropriate over the coming
months in order to return inflation sustainably to the target.
Seven members thought that the current policy stance
remained appropriate to balance the demands of the MPC’s
remit. Two members considered it appropriate to increase
Bank Rate by 25 basis points. All members agreed that any
prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at
a gradual pace and to a limited extent.

6 Inflation Report November 2017
Exchange rates
Changes in relative prospects for growth and interest rates
between countries tend to influence movements in exchange
rates.(1) In the run‑up to the November Report,
notwithstanding some volatility, the value of sterling was
broadly unchanged relative to three months ago (Chart 1.9).
While the sterling exchange rate has fluctuated, since the
EU referendum it has remained between 15%–20% below its
November 2015 peak. Market contacts ascribe much of that
fall to market participants having revised down UK growth
prospects relative to those in the rest of the world.
Corporate capital markets
Developments in capital markets influence the ease and cost
of raising finance for companies. These financing conditions
have changed little since August, and remain more favourable
than in early 2016, supported by the improvement in the
global growth outlook (Section 1.1) and greater investor risk
appetite. Consistent with that, financial market‑based
measures of investor uncertainty and sentiment — such as
implied volatilities — remain historically low.(2)
International equity prices have risen since August
(Chart 1.10). An important component of the cost of issuing
equity is equity risk premia — the additional return that
investors require for holding equities instead of less risky
government debt. Risk premia for euro‑area and US equities
are estimated to have changed little since August, but remain
considerably narrower than in early 2016 and are close to their
lowest levels in ten years.
Similarly to equities, the risk premia on corporate bonds — the
spread that investors require over and above government bond
yields for the additional risk of holding these assets — is also
broadly unchanged relative to three months ago, and remains
lower than in early 2016. Although government bond yields
have risen since 2016, spreads on corporate bonds have
narrowed by more. So overall corporate bond yields have
fallen (Chart 1.11), reducing the cost of bond financing for
companies. That fall in the cost of debt has been particularly
marked for ‘high‑yield’ debt, which is issued by riskier
companies.
Improvements in global risk sentiment do not appear,
however, to have been matched in sterling markets. This is
most obvious in equity markets. Much of the rise in the
FTSE All‑Share index since early 2016 (Chart 1.10) appears
primarily to have reflected the decline in the exchange rate
and its impact on the sterling value of profits earned on
overseas operations. Consistent with that, equity prices of

UK‑focused companies have underperformed relative to the
overall index (Chart 1.12). Despite significant falls in the
United States and euro area since early 2016, equity risk
premia on the FTSE All‑Share index are estimated to have
been broadly unchanged.
Bank funding costs
Capital markets also matter for broader credit conditions
through their influence on bank funding costs. Although they
have been broadly stable since August, the spreads that banks
pay for funding over and above market interest rates have
narrowed significantly over the past year (Chart 1.13). This
has contributed to many retail interest rates faced by
household and companies falling to historically low levels
(Section 2), and by more than the fall in market rates
(Chart 1.14). As explained in the box on pages 18–21, the
recent rises in market interest rates are expected to feed
through gradually into higher rates for households and
companies, unwinding some of the recent declines in these
retail rates. Market interest rates and bank funding costs,
however, remain low by historical standards.

8 Inflation Report November 2017
2 Demand
Consumption growth has slowed gradually since mid-2016, as sterling’s depreciation has squeezed
household real income growth. Consumption growth is projected to remain subdued in the near
term before picking up gradually as that squeeze abates. Offsetting some of the weakness in
consumption, business investment growth and net trade have risen, probably reflecting the
depreciation and strong global demand. They should continue to support modest overall growth in
the near term.
Sterling depreciated sharply following the EU referendum and,
since then, has remained 15%–20% below its late-2015 peak
(Section 1). That is raising UK import prices (Section 4) and
weighing on growth in households’ real income and spending.
Set against that, the depreciation, along with the strength of
global demand (Section 1), is also likely to be supporting
growth in exports, exporters’ profits and thus investment in
export capacity. Consistent with these developments,
following the latest data revisions the slowing in GDP growth
since the referendum has been accounted for by a steady
weakening in consumption growth (Chart 2.1). Partly
offsetting that, business investment growth and net trade
have picked up (Table 2.A).
Consumption growth is expected to remain subdued over the
next year, before picking up gradually as real income growth
recovers somewhat (Section 2.1). Housing investment should
be supported by the recent stabilisation in activity and prices
in the housing market (Section 2.2). In addition, the strength
in global growth should continue to support business
investment (Section 2.4) and net trade (Sections 2.5 and 2.6).
The outlook for demand will, however, depend crucially on
how households and companies anticipate and respond to the
prospect of the United Kingdom’s departure from the
European Union.
2.1 Household spending
The impact of sterling’s depreciation on inflation (Section 4)
has weighed on households’ purchasing power. Despite
support from robust employment growth in recent
quarters (Section 3), real pre-tax labour income is expected
to have been flat over the year to 2017 Q3 (Chart 2.2). Real
income growth is projected to start to recover gradually in
2018, although to remain modest. That reflects imported
inflation falling back and a pickup in pay growth (Section 4),
which outweigh the effects of slower employment
growth.

Section 2 Demand 9
Following recent data revisions, consumption growth is
estimated to have slowed only gradually over the year to
2017 Q2, less sharply than household real income growth. As
a result, the saving ratio — the proportion of overall income
that households save — declined (Chart 2.3). The overall level
of the saving ratio in recent years has, however, been revised
up reflecting an improved, and higher, measure of dividend
income. The box on pages 12–13 describes these revisions in
more detail. Moreover, although the current saving ratio is
still somewhat below its past average level, some parts of
household income such as those going directly to pension
schemes are likely to be less relevant for current spending
decisions.(1) A measure of saving out of available income,
which excludes those elements, has also fallen over the past
year but is around its historical average level (Chart 2.3).
The pace at which households continue to moderate their
spending growth in response to the current squeeze in real
income growth will depend on a number of factors. One of
those is how confident households are about their future
income growth. Aggregate consumer confidence (Chart 1.2)
and, within that, households’ expectations of their personal
financial situation have fallen over the past two years, but only
to slightly below their long-run averages.
Retail interest rates can also affect household spending. In
recent years, interest rates on mortgages, consumer credit and
deposits have all fallen to historically low levels (Chart 2.4).
In aggregate, that will have supported household spending
growth, in part by lowering the cost of consuming now relative
to in the future and by reducing debt-servicing costs for
borrowers. In addition to the fall in interest rates, broader
lending conditions in the consumer credit market have eased
and growth in consumer credit has been rapid in recent years.
As explained in the box on pages 16–17, the impact of rapid
consumer credit growth in recent years on spending growth is
likely to have been relatively modest and there are some signs
that overall consumer credit conditions are starting to tighten
slightly.
Following the recent rise in market interest rates (Section 1),
household interest rates are expected to pick up gradually,
though to remain at low levels. The box on pages 18–21
explores the likely impact on households’ interest payments,
using results on the distribution of household balance sheets
from the recent Bank/NMG survey.
Quarterly consumption growth is expected to have picked up
slightly from 0.2% in Q2 to 0.3% in Q3. Some of the
weakness in spending in Q2 looks to have been erratic, with
car purchases declining sharply. That decline is broadly

10 Inflation Report November 2017
consistent with the sharp fall in private new car registrations in
April (Chart 2.5), some of which may reflect an increase in
Vehicle Excise Duty on high-polluting vehicles. Since then, car
registrations have bounced back somewhat. Retail sales
volumes rose in Q3 and, together with survey indicators, point
to modest consumption growth. Housing market activity —
which tends to correlate fairly well with consumption growth
— picked up slightly (Section 2.2).
As at the time of the August Report, consumption growth is
projected to remain subdued in the near term (Table 2.B),
reflecting continued slow real income growth and the ongoing
adjustment to the past squeeze in real income growth.
Further ahead, consumption growth is projected to rise
gradually as the drag from sterling’s depreciation on real
income growth diminishes and wage growth picks up
(Section 5).
2.2 Housing market
As well as contributing directly to GDP through housing
investment, activity in the housing market can provide a signal
about household spending. This is in part because decisions
about whether to buy a house and how much to consume
tend to be driven by common factors such as interest rates,
income growth and confidence. Rises in house prices can also
affect spending by raising the value of homeowners’ equity,
which they can then use as collateral against which to borrow,
although this effect is estimated to be small.(1)
As discussed in the box on pages 17–18 of the August Report,
the housing market slowed in 2017 H1, consistent with the
squeeze in household income growth and subdued
consumption growth. Since then, housing transactions,
mortgage approvals and house price inflation have been
slightly stronger than expected (Chart 2.6). That may in
part reflect further falls in mortgage interest rates in Q3
(Section 1).
The outlook for the housing market remains fairly subdued,
with the balance of respondents to the September RICS
housing survey reporting lower price and sales expectations for
the coming months than earlier in the year. In the near term,
price inflation and activity in the housing market are projected
to remain well below past averages, broadly consistent with
the outlook for income and consumption.
While housing investment was weak in Q2 (Table 2.A), the
stabilisation in housing activity should provide some support
to measured housing investment in the near term. That is
because around a fifth of such investment is made up of
services associated with property transactions, such as estate
agents’ and solicitors’ fees.

The other four fifths of investment comprises spending on
new dwellings and improvements to existing dwellings. New
housing starts have picked up by 20% since the start of 2016,
although they fell back slightly in Q2. Housing investment
growth overall is projected to be fairly subdued in coming
quarters (Table 2.B).
2.3 Government spending
Public sector net borrowing was estimated to have been
£32.5 billion between April and September 2017, the smallest
figure at this point in the fiscal year since 2007. In addition,
estimates of borrowing in the fiscal year 2016/17 have been
revised down significantly since the initial estimate, in part
reflecting an upward revision to income tax and VAT receipts.
The MPC’s forecasts are conditioned on the Government’s tax
and spending plans detailed in the Spring 2017 Budget. Under
these plans, the fiscal consolidation continues, weighing on
overall GDP growth over the MPC’s forecast period.
2.4 Business investment
Following recent upward revisions, business investment is
estimated to have grown by 2½% in the year to 2017 Q2
(Chart 2.7), slightly above its past average rate. Nevertheless,
past falls mean that the level of investment remains low
relative to the size of the capital stock. That will continue to
weigh on growth in the capital stock and thus on productivity
and potential supply growth (Section 3).
Survey evidence suggests that the continuing strength of
global demand (Section 1) and high profit margins on export
sales following sterling’s depreciation are likely to be
supporting investment in export capacity. In addition, the rate
of return on capital, as measured by the ONS, remains high
and spare capacity appears to be fairly limited (Section 3).
Set against that, the depreciation of sterling will also
have raised the cost of investment because, with the
main exception of buildings, investment is relatively
import-intensive. In addition, a number of surveys suggest
that the anticipation of Brexit and related uncertainties are
weighing on investment. For instance, in a recent survey on
investment intentions by the Bank’s Agents, economic
uncertainty, expected changes to future UK trading
arrangements and other Brexit factors were the most
commonly cited factors weighing on investment plans.
While retained earnings are the most important source of
finance for capital spending, borrowing conditions can also
affect investment. The cost of corporate bond issuance
(Section 1) and of bank borrowing have fallen and credit
availability for many businesses has improved in recent years.

Revisions to the National Accounts and the
Balance of Payments
The Blue Book is an annual ONS publication in which National
Accounts data are revised to incorporate both a wider range
of information and methodological improvements. The
2017 Blue Book was published in October along with the
2017 Pink Book, which contained revisions to the Balance of
Payments.(1) Revisions to overall GDP and expenditure data
were fairly small and are described elsewhere in Sections 2
and 3. Revisions to the allocation of income and wealth
between sectors of the economy were, however, more
material. This box describes those changes in more detail.
Revisions to the sectoral allocation of income
There were two key revisions to the allocation of income. The
first was a reallocation of income from the corporate to the
household sector.(2) As discussed in the box on pages 16–17 of
the May Report, the ONS has switched to using HMRC tax
data to estimate dividend income. Those data suggest that
household dividend income has risen sharply over the past
two decades, from around 1.7% of pre-tax household income
in 1997 to 4.5% in 2016, as an increasing number of the
self-employed have chosen to incorporate their businesses and
to take part of their income in the form of dividends.(3)
That upward revision to dividend income has led to the
household saving ratio also being revised up (Section 2). As a
result, the household financial balance — which captures the
difference between household saving and investment — is now
estimated to have been positive rather than negative over
much of the recent past (Chart A). The counterpart to the rise
in household dividend income has been a fall in the income of
companies who have paid out those dividends. That revision
has pushed down on the corporate financial balance, which is
now estimated to have been negative over most of the past
five years.
The second key revision primarily affects the allocation of
income between the corporate sector and the rest of the
world. As discussed in the May Report, the ONS has revised
up the amount of interest that is estimated to have been paid
on UK corporate bonds. That has further reduced corporate
sector income and thus the corporate financial balance
(Chart A), since companies are now estimated to have been
paying more interest on their debt.
A significant proportion of those higher interest payments are
estimated to have been paid abroad. As a result, the current
account deficit, as a proportion of GDP, has been revised
around 1 percentage point wider on average since 2006
(Chart B). The current account deficit is estimated to have
widened to 4.6% of GDP in 2017 Q2, from 4.4% in Q1,
compared with 3.4% in the Q1 data available at the time of
the August Report. Those revisions reflect a more negative
balance on primary income — the net value of investment
income received by UK residents. In contrast, the trade
balance was broadly unrevised.
(1) For articles outlining the revisions in more detail, see https://www.ons.gov.uk/
economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/nationalaccountsarticles/
previousReleases.
(2) Throughout, the household sector refers to households and non-profit institutions
serving households (NPISH). As part of the changes incorporated in the
2017 Blue Book, however, estimates for households and NPISH are now presented
separately as well as jointly in the National Accounts.
(3) The upward revision to dividend income is partly offset by a reduction in mixed
income — the income of the self-employed — in recent years, as sole traders that
incorporated moved from the household to the corporate sector.

Revisions to the sectoral allocation of wealth
The Blue Book and Pink Book also contained revisions to the
allocation of wealth between sectors of the economy. While
estimates of household debt are broadly unchanged from
previously published data, the stock of household financial
assets has been revised down by £96 billion in 2016, or 2% of
household net financial wealth. Most of that downward
revision reflects lower estimated entitlements from defined
contribution pension schemes as a result of a switch to using
data from The Pensions Regulator. Those lower pension
entitlements have correspondingly raised the net wealth of
the corporate sector.
The changes incorporated in the Pink Book also have
implications for the net international investment position
(NIIP) — the stock of UK foreign assets less the liabilities owed
to other countries. Since those assets, net of liabilities, can be
used to finance the current account deficit, the level of the
NIIP may affect investors’ perceptions of how sustainable a
given current account deficit is likely to be.
The official measure of the NIIP in 2016 has been revised down
by 20% of GDP (Chart C). That downward revision primarily
reflects updated benchmarking of share ownership using the
2012 and 2014 Share Ownership Surveys, which suggest that
the value of UK equities held overseas is higher than previously
thought. The counterpart to that higher wealth held overseas
is a smaller amount of wealth held by financial corporations in
the United Kingdom.
Overall, the NIIP is now estimated to be slightly negative as a
share of annual GDP. The values of foreign direct investment
(FDI) assets and liabilities within that are, however, difficult to
measure accurately.(1) Official estimates use the book or
purchase value of these assets. Another approach is to try to
adjust for changes in the market value using movements in
equity prices. One such measure suggests that, despite the
downward revision, the NIIP remains significantly positive, at
around 75% of GDP (Chart C).

14 Inflation Report November 2017
In the latest Credit Conditions Survey, however, lenders
reported that the cost of corporate credit rose in Q3 and
was expected to rise slightly further in Q4. The box on
pages 18–21 explores the likely impact of a rise in interest
rates on companies’ financing conditions.
Total net finance raised by companies remained robust in Q3,
driven by a pickup in bond issuance (Chart 2.8). Having risen
sharply in Q2, bank lending fell back; but that volatility largely
reflected the effects of a few large mergers and acquisitions
during the summer.
Investment growth is expected to have slowed slightly in
2017 Q3, before picking back up to rates broadly consistent
with surveys of investment intentions on average (Chart 2.7).
That is a similar outlook to that in August (Table 2.B), but
weaker than would have been expected given global and
financial conditions alone (Section 5).
2.5 Exports
The strength in global demand, along with the depreciation in
sterling (Section 1), is likely to be supporting growth in export
volumes. Between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q2, export prices fell by
5% in foreign currency terms, suggesting some improvement
in competitiveness. But they rose by 12% in sterling terms,
meaning that the profit margins on exports are also likely to
have increased. That rise in margins is likely to support an
expansion in export volumes among firms with spare capacity.
As that capacity is eroded, and for firms with limited spare
capacity, those higher margins should also provide an
incentive to invest (Section 2.4), thus boosting export volumes
further over time. The outlook for exports and related
investment will, however, also depend on how both domestic
and foreign companies anticipate and respond to changes in
the United Kingdom’s trading arrangements.
In the latest data, growth in export volumes over the year to
Q2 was robust, at 5% (Chart 2.9). Growth in exports of goods
— just over half of the total — was particularly strong. Capital
and intermediate goods accounted for much of that strength,
consistent with the strength in global capital goods orders
(Section 1).
Four-quarter growth in aggregate exports is expected to have
risen further in Q3, broadly in line with survey indicators
(Chart 2.9). Further ahead, export growth is projected to slow
somewhat but will continue to be supported by the strength in
global growth and the recent rise in exporters’ margins
(Section 5).

Section 2 Demand 15
2.6 Imports and net trade
Growth in imports will depend on growth in overall final
demand as well as its composition, as some components are
more import-intensive than others. In addition, sterling’s
depreciation is likely to encourage some substitution away
from imports towards domestically produced goods and
services, which have become relatively cheaper.
Import growth was solid over the year to Q2. That was
mainly accounted for by strong growth in goods imports,
which in part appears to reflect buoyant final demand for
UK exports that tend to be embedded in global supply chains
(Section 2.5). Relative to overall final demand, however,
import volumes have increased over the past year
(Chart 2.10). That may in part be because relative import
prices remain lower than over most of the past decade, even
after the recent pickup. In addition, following a rise in import
prices, it typically takes some time for producers of domestic
substitutes to increase output due to capacity constraints and
the need to shift resources, and for companies reliant on
imports to adjust existing supply chains. Partly as a result of
those constraints starting to diminish, import growth is
projected to slow in coming quarters.
Following recent revisions, net trade is estimated to have
contributed positively to GDP growth in recent quarters
(Chart 2.1). In Q3, net trade is expected to have subtracted
from GDP growth, mainly reflecting a change in the direction
of trade in non-monetary gold from a net export in Q2 to a
net import in Q3. That is a volatile component of UK trade,
reflecting activity in the London gold bullion market, and has
no impact on aggregate demand; movements in
non-monetary gold are offset by movements in private sector
investment in valuables. This component, and therefore
overall net trade, is likely to bounce back in Q4. Net trade is
projected to continue to provide further support in coming
quarters (Table 2.B), as import growth slows by more than
export growth (Section 5).

Developments in consumer credit
Consumer credit includes household borrowing through credit
cards, dealership car finance and other unsecured debt such as
personal loans. Although only 11% of the stock of household
debt, strong consumer credit growth (Chart A) has accounted
for around a third of the overall increase in net lending to
households since 2012. This box explores the possible drivers
of this growth and the characteristics of the households who
have taken out consumer credit recently. It then examines the
ways in which such credit can influence household spending,
before discussing the outlook for consumer credit.
Drivers of the growth in consumer credit in recent
years
Robust household demand is likely to have supported
consumer credit growth over 2014–16. Consumer confidence
and, within that, households’ expectations of their personal
financial situation were above their past average rates over
much of this period (Section 2). This, together with steady
falls in unemployment (Section 3), will have encouraged
households to make major purchases and, for some, to take
out consumer credit to help smooth out the costs of financing
those purchases.
In addition, there has been a material easing in consumer
credit supply conditions in recent years, reflecting intense
competition and falls in bank funding costs (Section 1). For
example, the quoted interest rate on a £10,000 personal loan
has fallen by around 4 percentage points since 2012, reaching
a record low in 2017 H1 (Table 1). Other terms and conditions
have also eased, with a marked lengthening in interest-free
periods on credit card balance transfers.
Furthermore, there has been a structural shift in the way car
purchases are financed, with around 90% of new cars bought
with dealership car finance in 2016, compared with around
50% in 2009. Such finance typically involves personal
contract purchases (PCP), a type of agreement with fixed
monthly payments that are lower than other forms of car
finance. That is because at the end of the loan customers
either make an additional payment for a pre-agreed amount
to purchase the car or return the vehicle to the dealer. This
structural shift will have boosted consumer credit growth,
partly because the entire amount of PCP loans are recorded as
credit, even though not all customers will make that final
payment to purchase the car.
Dealership car finance has accounted for around half of the
overall increase in consumer credit since 2013 (Chart A), and
will have boosted overall consumer credit growth. As much of
that shift in the way car purchases are financed has now
occurred, the strong contribution from dealership car finance
to consumer credit growth has started to fall and is likely to
ease somewhat further in coming years.(1)
Around half of the growth in the stock of consumer credit over
2015 and 2016 is estimated to have been concentrated in
borrowers who did not previously have such debt. According
to Bank/NMG surveys carried out in 2017, households who
had recently taken out consumer credit were more likely to
have high incomes. Around 40% of households with
consumer credit also held savings in excess of the balance on
their consumer debt. And around half of households who also
had a mortgage reported that, on balance, it was cheaper or
easier to obtain a personal loan than to increase their
mortgage borrowing.

pages 18–19 of the June 2017 Financial Stability Report; www.bankofengland.co.uk/

Section 2 Demand 17
According to the latest NMG survey, the proportion of
households reporting that unsecured debt is a burden picked
up in 2017 but remains below recent highs (Chart B). Perhaps
consistent with that, lenders responding to the Q3 Credit
Conditions Survey reported that default rates had increased a
little, although the performance of consumer credit lending
remained generally strong.
Links between consumer credit growth and
consumption
Developments in household spending growth are likely to be
reflected in demand for consumer credit. But in addition,
changes in consumer credit driven by an increase in credit
supply can boost spending directly. One crude way of gauging
the size of such effects is simply to compare increases in the
net flow of new consumer credit with increases in
consumption. On that basis, since 2012 the increase in the
flow of consumer credit accounted for only 8% of the increase
in consumption.
The actual impact of consumer credit growth on spending,
however, could well be smaller or larger than that simple
approach. On the one hand, not all consumer credit
necessarily generates additional spending as some households
who take out credit to spend may have savings they would
otherwise have used. On the other hand, any increase in
spending due to increases in credit growth is likely to support
demand and so overall household income. That can then lead
to further increases in spending over and above the initial
boost. Overall, it appears unlikely that the increase in the net
flow of consumer credit has been a material driver of the
increase in consumption in recent years.
Recent developments and the outlook
Four-quarter growth in consumer credit has eased slightly over
2017, to 9.9% in Q3 (Chart A). That appears largely to reflect
softer demand for credit, with consumption growth slowing in
recent quarters (Section 2.1). In particular, growth in car
finance has eased, consistent with the weakness in new car
purchases, although part of that easing is also likely to reflect
the end of the structural shift in the way car purchases are
financed.
There are also signs that consumer credit supply conditions
may have started to tighten slightly. The average interest-free
period on credit card balance transfers has shortened a little
(Table 1). And in the latest Credit Conditions Survey, lenders
reported that unsecured credit availability had fallen in Q3
and was expected to fall further in Q4. Nevertheless,
competition in the consumer credit market remains intense.
Consumer credit growth is projected to remain robust,
although to moderate further in coming years (Section 5), in
part as the structural shift towards greater use of dealership
finance in car purchases continues to run its course.
Developments in consumer credit are relevant to financial
stability. As discussed in the June 2017 Financial Stability
Report, falling interest margins on lending do not appear to
have been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in
the underlying credit quality of new lending. The Prudential
Regulation Authority’s (PRA’s) review of consumer credit
lending, published in July, found that the resilience of lenders’
portfolios had been falling.(1) In the Record of its September
meeting, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) set out that it
judges that there is a pocket of risk in the rapid growth of
consumer credit.(2) While not a material risk to economic
growth through its effect on household spending, it is a risk to
banks’ ability to withstand severe economic downturns and
therefore potentially to financial stability. The FPC has
responded to this risk by accelerating its analysis of credit
losses that banks could incur in the very deep recession
encapsulated in the 2017 annual stress-test scenario.
Although the overall credit quality of consumer credit has
improved significantly since the financial crisis, the FPC judges
that lenders overall are placing too much weight on the recent
performance of loans in benign conditions as an indicator of
underlying credit quality. As a result, they have been
underestimating the losses they could incur in a downturn.
This is just one element of the overall stress test, results for
which will be published on 28 November and used to set
regulatory capital buffers.

18 Inflation Report November 2017
The sensitivity of households and companies
to changes in interest rates
During the financial crisis, the MPC reduced Bank Rate to 0.5%
and conducted a programme of asset purchases to support
spending. As a result, interest rates for households and
companies fell significantly. In August 2016, as the economy
showed early signs of an abrupt hit to activity and confidence
following the EU referendum, the MPC voted to introduce a
package of measures to support the economy. That included a
further cut in Bank Rate to 0.25%.(1) These measures were
calibrated to balance the trade‑off that emerged immediately
after the referendum between ensuring a sustainable return of
inflation to the target and supporting jobs and activity. Since
then, funding costs of banks have also declined significantly
relative to reference rates (Section 1), and so many household
and corporate interest rates have fallen further to historically
low levels (Chart 1.14 and Chart 2.4).
More recently, market interest rates have risen slightly
reflecting expectations that the MPC will raise Bank Rate
(Section 1). While that market‑implied path for Bank Rate
implies only a very gradual rise in coming years, it does imply
some unwinding of the most recent falls in interest rates for
households and companies.
Changes in the current and expected level of Bank Rate
influence spending through a number of channels. They can
affect the exchange rate, and therefore external demand.
They influence domestic demand via changes in domestic
asset prices and levels of wealth.
A more direct channel operates via retail interest rates. By
raising the real cost of borrowing and the return on saving,
rises in interest rates reduce the incentive to spend today
relative to in the future. They also raise payments on existing
debt and deposits. Spending by net borrowers tends to be
more sensitive to these changes in cash flow than net savers,
reducing spending in aggregate.
This box examines the impact of changes in Bank Rate on
those cash flows, across households and firms. It draws on a
range of evidence including the latest Bank/NMG survey of
household finances.(2)
Households
Pass-through to effective interest rates facing
households
By raising the cost at which banks can obtain funding,
increases in Bank Rate and market interest rates will increase
the interest rates on new borrowing and deposits for
households. How quickly that feeds through to the interest
rates on existing saving and borrowing will depend on the
proportion of those balances that are ‘floating rate’ — linked
to Bank Rate or market interest rates. For savers and
borrowers with ‘fixed‑rate’ products, the interest rates on
those products will only change when the fixed‑rate period
comes to an end.
Around a third of households have a mortgage on their home.
In aggregate, mortgage debt represents around three quarters
of the overall stock of household debt. The share of fixed‑rate
mortgages by value has risen significantly in recent years to
around 60% of the stock of mortgages (Chart A). So while a
change in Bank Rate would feed through to some mortgages
quite quickly, the overall effect would be relatively gradual.
Even as interest rates start to rise, past falls (Chart 2.4) may
mean that some mortgagors will continue to move onto lower
interest rates than they had previously, when their fixed rates
expire. For example, someone moving from an expiring
five‑year fixed rate to a new one could see rates fall by around
200 basis points, and for two‑year fixed rates the fall could
be around 30 basis points.

Section 2 Demand 19
Other components of household borrowing — such as
consumer credit and student loans — are less directly sensitive
to Bank Rate. The interest rates on these products tend to be
either fixed rate (Table 1) or driven predominantly by factors
other than Bank Rate (for consumer credit, see the box on
pages 16–17). In particular, the size of monthly repayments on
student loans are determined entirely by borrower income and
are unrelated to the loan interest rate or principal outstanding.
On loans extended since 2012–13, borrowers repay 9% of
income above £21,000 and nothing if earnings are below this
threshold.
By comparison, only around one quarter of household deposits
are fixed rate (Table 1). So a rise in Bank Rate may feed
through to effective saving rates more quickly than to
borrowing rates on average.
Sensitivity of household income to changes in interest
rates
As a rise in interest rates is passed through, the sizes of
household debt and deposits will determine the direct
‘cash‑flow’ impact on households’ income and spending. In
aggregate, total debt‑servicing costs relative to income —
interest payments plus repayments of principal — have fallen
fairly steadily in recent years (Chart B). That has been more
than accounted for by a decline in interest payments, which
are at a historically low level relative to income. Principal
repayments have risen relative to income.
Among the third of households who have a mortgage on their
home, the average outstanding balance in June 2017 was
around £125,000 with an average repayment term of 16 years
remaining. Once passed on in full, a 25 basis point rise in
Bank Rate would lead to an increase in the servicing cost of
that average mortgage of around £15 a month. Just over a
fifth of those who have a mortgage, around two million
households, are likely to have never experienced a rise in
Bank Rate since they became a mortgagor. Almost half of
those are estimated to have taken out a mortgage since
July 2014, when the FPC’s Recommendation on affordability
tests was implemented. As a result, those households will
have been tested when taking out the mortgage to ensure
they can still afford their mortgages were Bank Rate to rise by
300 basis points.
The majority of households do not have mortgages. And, in
aggregate, the stock of household debt has fallen since prior to
the crisis, relative to household income (Chart C). Student
loans, in particular, have accounted for an increasing share of
aggregate debt in recent years. Excluding student loans, the
fall in debt over the past decade as a proportion of income is

even more marked. Student loans are likely to continue to
push up household debt in coming years; excluding them,
debt is projected to grow broadly in line with income.
In addition to the fall in aggregate debt relative to income,
deposits have risen faster than income over the past decade.
As a result, the direct impact of an increase in Bank Rate on
household cash flow in aggregate may be more modest now
than in the recent past. For example, based on the current
stock of debt and deposits and assuming full and immediate
pass‑through to both, including non‑mortgage debt, a
25 basis point rise in interest rates would increase monthly net
interest payments by £4 per household, on average, equivalent
to a reduction of 0.1% of post‑tax income. Because a greater
share of mortgages are fixed rate than deposits, though, this
would be somewhat smaller at first, and take some time to
come through.
The impact on spending of a rise in interest rates via this
cash‑flow channel will depend on how households respond.
Evidence from the NMG survey in recent years suggests that
the spending of net borrowers is more sensitive than that of
net savers to changes in their cash flow. For example, the
results suggest that in response to an extra £20 of interest
payments, borrowers would reduce spending by around £10
on average. In contrast, in response to an increase of £20 in
their interest income, savers on average would increase
spending by only £2. The latest findings from the 2017 H2
NMG survey suggest the sizes of those responses are likely to
be similar or slightly smaller than in the past.
Even within these broad categories there are likely to be
significant variations in the response to a change in interest
rates. Mortgagors with relatively high debt‑servicing ratios
may need to cut back spending by more if interest rates rise.
As explained on page 4 of the June 2017 Financial Stability
Report, high mortgage debt‑servicing ratios are typically
associated with a sharp increase in the incidence of repayment
difficulties. The NMG survey suggests that, having fallen
during the financial crisis, the share of households with a
mortgage debt‑servicing ratio above 40% of pre‑tax income
has risen since 2015 (Chart D). That share remains around
pre‑crisis lows, however, and a 25 basis point rise in interest
rates — even if passed through fully and immediately to all
mortgage rates — would increase the share only slightly (the
diamond in Chart D). It would probably take a further rise of
around 1½ percentage points before this proportion returned
to its pre‑crisis average of 2%, even assuming no rise in
nominal incomes.
Companies
The sensitivity of business investment to increases in interest
rates will depend on how the overall cost of finance facing
companies is affected, and how reliant businesses are on
borrowing to fund investment.
Pass‑through to companies’ financing costs
The vast majority of corporate bank debt has a floating
interest rate (Table 1). While some companies will purchase
financial instruments to hedge their floating‑rate exposures
and so reduce their sensitivity to changes in interest rates,
market intelligence suggests that has become less common in
recent years. Any rise in Bank Rate is therefore likely to pass
through fairly quickly to the cost of bank borrowing for
companies.
In aggregate, however, UK private non‑financial corporations
(PNFCs) have reduced their reliance on bank debt since 2009.
This is partly due to a significant deleveraging in the
commercial real estate sector, which in 2009 accounted for
over 40% of aggregate corporate debt. Intelligence from the
Bank’s Agents suggests that it also reflects a broader shift in
the way businesses finance investment. Companies now use a
greater proportion of financing from internal funds and, for
large companies, bond and equity issuance (Chart 2.8).
In addition, company deposits have continued to grow
steadily. As a result, the size of companies’ overall debt net of
deposits has fallen materially relative to their profits in recent
years (Chart E). That will have reduced the negative impact of
any rise in interest rates on the profitability of the corporate
sector.

2015. Data from 2011 to 2014 surveys have been spliced on to 2015 data to produce a
consistent time series. The diamond shows estimated share of households with
debt‑servicing ratio greater than 40% if interest rates rise by 25 basis points and
pass‑through to loan rates is full and immediate, and income is unchanged.
Section 2 Demand 21
Sensitivity of companies’ profits to changes in interest
rates
Mainly as a result of falls in bank debt and falls in interest
rates, the aggregate debt‑servicing ratio — the share of profits
required to meet monthly debt repayments — has also fallen
to very low levels in recent years (Chart E). As shown by the
diamond in Chart E, a 25 basis point rise passed through fully
and immediately to all borrowing rates would increase this
metric by around 0.5 percentage points, leaving it still well
below its level in recent decades.
Despite the likelihood of a more benign impact on aggregate
profitability than in the past, spending by less profitable
companies may be more sensitive to changes in interest costs.
According to 2016/17 financial accounts data, the proportion
of companies whose profit does not currently cover their
interest payments was smaller than in preceding years, and
slightly below its level in 2006 (Chart F). As shown by the
diamond in Chart F, a 25 basis point rise in effective interest
rates, even if passed through fully and immediately to all loan
rates, would increase this metric only slightly.

22 Inflation Report November 2017
3 Output and supply
Output growth has been modest in recent quarters. In contrast, growth in employment has
remained fairly robust and the unemployment rate has fallen by more than expected. Accordingly,
productivity growth has been weak and is expected to remain subdued. The modest outlook for
growth in supply capacity will limit the pace at which output can grow without generating
inflationary pressure.
The outlook for output growth depends on the evolution of
demand (Section 2) and the economy’s potential supply
capacity. Faster growth in demand relative to potential supply
will erode the degree of slack in the economy and, all else
equal, eventually result in domestic inflationary pressure
(Section 4), as existing capital and labour are used more
intensively.
Since the end of the financial crisis, output growth has,
unusually, been driven largely by increases in hours worked,
with little growth in productivity (Chart 3.1). Although output
growth has been subdued in recent quarters (Section 3.1), the
increase in the total number of hours worked — in particular,
growth in the number of people in work — has largely held up
(Section 3.2). As a result, slack in the economy appears to
have narrowed further and probably only a little remains.
The unemployment rate — an indicator of labour market
slack — fell to 4.3% in the three months to August, a little
below the MPC’s estimate of the equilibrium rate made in
February 2017.(1)
As slack in the economy has been absorbed, the outlook for
output growth has become increasingly dependent on how
quickly productivity can rise. The trend rate of productivity
growth appears to have fallen in recent years, meaning that
overall potential supply has grown more slowly than in the
past (Section 3.3). And the effect of Brexit-related
uncertainties, including the subdued outlook for business
investment (Section 2), is likely to weigh further on
productivity growth in coming years. As a result of that
diminished rate of supply growth, the pace at which demand
can expand before it leads to domestic inflationary pressure is
likely to be modest (Section 5).

Section 3 Output and supply 23
3.1 Output
Having slowed somewhat in recent quarters, output growth
remained modest at 0.4% in Q3 according to the preliminary
estimate of GDP (Chart 3.2). That was 0.1 percentage points
higher than projected three months ago.
The profile of GDP growth in recent years has been revised in
the latest data. While on average the revisions have been
fairly small, they point to a more gradual slowing in
four-quarter growth since 2015 than previously estimated.
Recent estimates are likely to be revised further once the ONS
receives and incorporates a fuller range of data. The MPC’s
backcast, which takes into account information from business
surveys and the past revision properties of the official data,
points to an even more gradual slowing in growth.
The majority of the slowdown in output growth since the end
of 2016 has been accounted for by slower growth within the
service sector (Chart 3.3). Part of that may reflect sluggish
growth in household consumption, as higher import prices
following sterling’s depreciation have weighed on households’
purchasing power (Section 2).
Having stalled in 2017 H1, manufacturing output growth
picked up sharply in Q3 (Chart 3.3). The weakness in the
first half of the year was partly due to erratic factors. A sharp
fall in output in the pharmaceuticals sector in Q1 unwound
unusual strength in 2016 Q4. And a large fall in
manufacturing of transport equipment in Q2 mostly unwound
in Q3. In contrast to the official data, survey indicators of
activity have pointed to an above-average expansion in
manufacturing output over the course of 2017, consistent with
the support to exporters from sterling’s depreciation and the
strength in global demand (Section 2).
Overall output growth is projected to remain modest at
0.4% in Q4 (Chart 3.2), although there are risks around this
projection. Survey indicators of expected activity growth
point to a range of outturns for GDP growth in Q4. The
CBI measure points to stronger growth, while the IHS Markit/
CIPS measure fell in Q3 and points to weaker growth.
3.2 Labour market developments
In contrast to the slowdown in output growth in recent
quarters, growth in total hours worked has largely held up
(Chart 3.4). That was mainly accounted for by growth in the
number of people in work, although growth is likely to have
slowed somewhat in Q3 (Table 3.A). Average hours worked
per person are expected to have been broadly unchanged in
the year to Q3.

24 Inflation Report November 2017
The recent growth in aggregate employment appears to have
been driven mainly by a reduction in the rate at which people
are leaving their jobs, while the rate at which people enter
employment, although volatile, has remained broadly stable
(Chart 3.5). The flows from employment to unemployment
have been at record lows in recent quarters, probably
reflecting strength in companies’ labour demand growth and a
desire to hold on to existing workers, especially in light of
subdued wage pressures (Section 4). Relatedly, the rate of
redundancies has remained low (Table 3.B). In addition, the
squeeze on real income (Section 2) may have encouraged
some individuals who would otherwise have left the labour
force to stay in employment.
Indicators suggest that companies’ labour demand growth is
likely to remain relatively robust in the near term. Most
survey measures of employment intentions are above their
historical averages (Table 3.B). And the number of vacancies
relative to the size of the labour force — one indicator of hiring
intentions — has picked up in recent quarters and remained
elevated in Q3.
One consequence of the robust growth in employment has
been a tightening in the labour market. Most survey measures
of recruitment difficulties have increased (Table 3.B). And the
unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in the three months to
August (Chart 3.6). That was lower than expected at the time
of the August Report, and a little below the MPC’s estimate of
the equilibrium unemployment rate made in February 2017.
As set out in the February Report, however, there remains
significant uncertainty around that estimate and there is a
range of views among MPC members.
The past tightening in the labour market is likely to lead to
greater upward pressure on wage growth (Section 4). The
outlook for labour market tightness will depend not only on
companies’ demand for labour but also on developments in
labour supply.
One important determinant of labour supply is the proportion
of the population participating in the labour market, either by
working or by looking for employment. The participation rate
has risen in recent years and was slightly higher than
anticipated in 2017 Q2, although it is expected to have fallen
back somewhat in Q3 (Chart 3.7).
The participation rate is expected to remain broadly flat in
coming years, reflecting two offsetting factors. The rising
average age of the population is likely to weigh on aggregate
labour force participation because the participation rate of
older people tends to be lower. But participation rates among
older people have increased steadily in recent years and this
trend is expected to continue. In addition, as discussed above,
it is possible that the squeeze in real income following
sterling’s depreciation (Section 2) may encourage some

Section 3 Output and supply 25
individuals to enter the labour market in order to supplement
their household income, or to remain in work for longer than
they otherwise would have.
Growth in labour supply will also be determined by population
growth. In the MPC’s latest forecasts, population growth is
assumed to evolve in line with the ONS’s projection published
in October 2015. In the ONS’s most recent projection,
published on 26 October 2017, the population grows a little
more slowly in coming years than previously projected.
A key influence on population growth is net migration to the
United Kingdom. Net migration levels fell from 327,000 in
the year to 2016 Q1 to 246,000 in the year to 2017 Q1, due
mainly to a fall in net migration from the European Union
(Chart 3.8). The ONS projects net migration to fall somewhat
further in coming years, although that path is very uncertain
and will depend on a number of factors including the
United Kingdom’s relative economic performance, the sterling
exchange rate and government policy.
Although changes in net migration affect labour supply, they
also affect domestic demand. As a result, past shifts in net
migration do not appear to have had a significant direct
impact on slack or aggregate wage growth.(1) But intelligence
from the Bank’s Agents suggests that, were migration to fall
abruptly, that could have more significant short-term
consequences for supply — and hence for inflationary pressure
— in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant
labour.
Overall, labour market indicators point to some rebound in
employment growth in Q4, following weakness in Q3, and a
further slight fall in unemployment (Chart 3.6). Beyond that,
labour demand and supply growth are projected to be modest,
and unemployment to be broadly flat (Section 5).
3.3 Productivity
Given the tightening in the labour market and projected
modest labour supply growth, the outlook for overall supply
growth will increasingly depend on growth in productivity.
Hourly productivity fell by 0.1% in the year to Q2 (Chart 3.9),
as output growth slowed while growth in hours worked held
up (Section 3.2). That was weaker than expected in August, in
part due to a downward revision to four-quarter GDP growth
in the latest data (Section 3.1). Productivity growth is
expected to pick up very gradually in the near term as any
remaining spare capacity within firms is absorbed, but to
remain weak relative to its past average.

26 Inflation Report November 2017
Some of the recent weakness in productivity growth may have
been caused by a shift in the composition of employment
growth. Employment growth in the year to 2017 Q2 was
more concentrated in occupations and industries associated
with lower wages than usual (Section 4). To the extent that
these characteristics are also associated with lower levels of
productivity, this shift in workforce composition will have
dragged on aggregate productivity growth as well as pay
growth. But these compositional effects will only bear down
on productivity growth for as long as such shifts continue.
More broadly, productivity growth has been so weak since the
onset of the financial crisis that the level of productivity is
barely above its pre-crisis peak a decade ago (Chart 3.10).
Part of that weakness in recent years has been caused by slow
growth in the capital stock — the resources and equipment
available to produce output — relative to hours worked
(Chart 3.9). That is the result of weak business investment
(Section 2). In addition, the efficiency with which labour and
capital are put to use — known as total factor productivity
(TFP) — is estimated to have fallen sharply during the financial
crisis and remained subdued since then. That weakness in
TFP growth has been a global phenomenon, perhaps in part
reflecting low diffusion of technology between the most
productive firms and the rest.(1) The persistent weakness of
productivity growth has meant that the MPC’s forecasts for
productivity have been revised down repeatedly in recent
years.
In addition to the factors that have weighed on it since the
crisis, productivity growth is likely to be further constrained by
firms’ anticipation of and response to post-Brexit trading
arrangements. Uncertainty around the outlook for these
arrangements is likely to weigh on investment in the capital
stock (Section 2). Any reduction and reorientation of trade
and supply chains is also likely to weigh on TFP growth, for
example as some companies in the United Kingdom shift from
supplying customers in the European Union to those in the
rest of the world, and may result in some existing supply
capacity becoming obsolete.(2)
Taken together, these factors are consistent with productivity
growth remaining subdued in coming years. Alongside modest
labour supply growth, that will weigh on growth in the
United Kingdom’s overall potential supply capacity, which in
turn will limit the speed at which output can grow before it
leads to domestic inflationary pressure (Section 5).

Section 4 Costs and prices 27
4 Costs and prices
CPI inflation rose to 3.0% in September. It is expected to peak at 3.2% in October, as increases in
imported costs — stemming from the past fall in sterling and a more recent pickup in global energy
prices — are passed on to consumer prices. Inflation is then expected to fall back as past rises in
energy prices drop out of the annual comparison and as the pass-through of rises in other import
prices progresses. Alongside that moderation in external pressures, however, domestic inflationary
pressures are likely to build to more normal levels.
4.1 Consumer price developments and the
near-term outlook
CPI inflation increased to 3.0% in September from 2.6% in
June, slightly above the 2.8% projected at the time of the
August Report (Chart 4.1). That upside news reflected
larger-than-expected contributions from clothing and
footwear prices and retail fuel.
The increase in inflation to above the MPC’s 2% target over
the past year reflects the effects of the continued rise in
import prices following sterling’s depreciation (Section 4.2).
Over this period, inflation has picked up most in those
components that tend to have the greatest imported content,
such as food, energy and other goods (Chart 4.2). The rise in
global oil prices in recent months has added somewhat to
external cost pressures and is likely to feed through to retail
fuel prices, and therefore to CPI inflation, relatively quickly.
Inflation is likely to rise further in the near term, peaking at
3.2% in October (Chart 4.1), before starting to fall back. The
pace and extent of that fall will depend in part on the path for
external and domestic cost pressures facing companies.
Although the positive contribution of higher retail fuel prices is
expected largely to have dissipated by the end of the year, the
effect of the past fall in sterling on non-energy imported cost
growth is expected to diminish only gradually (Section 4.2).
Alongside that, domestic inflationary pressures are likely to
build to more normal levels in coming years (Section 4.3). In
particular, unit labour cost growth is expected to be supported
by a gradual rise in wage growth in response to the tightening
in labour market conditions. Inflation expectations remain
consistent with inflation returning to the target in the medium
term (Section 4.4).

28 Inflation Report November 2017
4.2 External cost pressures
The increase in inflation over the past year has been driven by
an increase in the cost of imports, which forms a significant
part of the costs facing UK companies. That, in turn, has
largely reflected the depreciation of sterling, which, since the
EU referendum, has remained 15%–20% below its peak in
November 2015 (Section 1). The prices of some global
commodities, such as oil and metals, have also picked up in
recent months.
Energy
US dollar oil prices have risen since the August Report
(Chart 4.3). Some of that rise is likely to have reflected
stronger global demand (Section 1). Market contacts report
that the disruption to supply from recent events, such as the
Atlantic hurricane season, has also pushed up oil prices, as has
the continued implementation of the November 2016
agreement between some oil producers to curb production
over 2017.
The cost of oil accounts for around one third of the cost of
retail fuel and tends to be passed on to fuel prices relatively
quickly. The rise in global prices means that, in the run-up to
the November Report, the price of oil was 17% higher in
sterling terms than at the time of the August Report
(Chart 4.4). The contribution of fuel prices to CPI inflation
picked up in September (Section 4.1) and is expected to
remain higher in the near term than was projected in August.
Although the spot price of oil has increased, the oil futures
curve, on which the MPC’s forecasts are conditioned, has
moved by less and is now downward sloping (Chart 4.4). As a
result, the contribution of fuel prices to overall inflation is
expected to be more negative from 2018 H2 than projected in
August (Section 5).
UK wholesale gas prices also tend to be influenced by changes
in global oil prices. Consequently, sterling wholesale gas prices
have risen since August, with the sterling gas futures curve, on
which the MPC’s projections are conditioned, around 5%
higher (Chart 4.4). The pass-through of wholesale gas prices
to retail prices tends to take much longer than for changes in
oil prices and the degree of pass-through varies over time. In
the near term, rises in retail electricity and gas prices by the
major providers earlier in the year will continue to boost the
contribution of utility prices to inflation until they drop out of
the annual comparison in the first half of 2018 (Table 4.A).

Section 4 Costs and prices 29
Non-energy imported costs
Most of the increase in inflation over the past year has been
driven by an increase in the cost of non-energy imports facing
UK companies. Sterling non-energy import prices increased by
10% between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q2, and are expected to rise
further over 2018. By far the biggest driver of the rise in
import prices has been the depreciation of sterling over this
period (Chart 4.5). World export prices — the foreign
currency prices companies in other countries charge for their
exports, weighted according to countries’ shares in UK imports
— have also increased recently, with annual growth of 3% in
Q2. In part, that reflects the recent pickup in oil and other
commodity prices (Chart 4.3), which are inputs into the
production of many other goods.
The pickup in import prices since the end of 2015 has been
substantial, but to date it remains less than the average
response to similarly sized falls in sterling over the past. As
explained in the box on pages 28–29 of the November 2015
Report, Bank staff estimated that, on average, 60% of changes
in the sterling value of world export prices tend to be reflected
in UK import prices, with that pass-through taking around a
year. As of 2017 Q2, only around 50% of the increase in world
export prices in sterling terms has been reflected in higher
import prices.
While this could suggest the overall rise in import prices will
be more limited than in the past, there are reasons why
pass-through to import prices is likely to be slower on this
occasion. For example, elevated uncertainty before the
referendum may have encouraged UK importers and foreign
exporters to the United Kingdom to hedge their sterling
exposures for longer periods than usual. That would delay the
pace at which the fall in sterling is passed on to UK companies’
input costs. Volatility in sterling may also have led foreign
exporters to delay or moderate adjustments to their prices
until they were more certain of the appropriate level. As a
result, the past depreciation in sterling is projected to continue
pushing up import prices in coming quarters. Survey measures
of input cost growth remain consistent with that continued
pass-through (Chart 4.5).
Import price pass-through to consumer prices
A natural consequence of the pass-through of rising import
prices to consumer prices is an initial compression and then a
gradual rebuild in the domestic profit margins on consumer
goods and services. One measure of these margins — the
difference between estimated costs, including import and
labour costs, and consumer price inflation — suggests profit
margins have narrowed since 2016 H1 as imported costs have
increased (Charts 4.6 and 4.7).

Table 4.A Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements
30 Inflation Report November 2017
There is some uncertainty around estimates of profit margins,
but a number of indicators point to a compression in
consumer margins relative to those in the broader economy.
That is consistent with exporters’ profits having been boosted
by the fall in sterling’s exchange rate (Section 2).(1) Estimates
derived from firms’ financial accounts suggest that, while the
operating margins of UK-focused firms in the FTSE All-Share
index have narrowed since 2016, those of other companies in
the index have not.(2) And survey indicators of profitability —
such as the EEF measure — and intelligence from the Bank’s
Agents suggest that margins on domestic sales have been
lower than those on exports over the recent past.
The pass-through of higher import prices, as companies try to
restore their margins on consumer goods and services, has
been the key driver of higher CPI inflation over the past year.
It is likely to continue to push up inflation for several years as
import costs continue to rise and as those margins are rebuilt.
The precise impact on inflation will, however, depend on the
speed at which companies rebuild their margins and the extent
to which they do so by raising output prices or reducing other
costs. Over the past, changes in import prices have tended to
be passed on to consumer prices in aggregate broadly in line
with the share of imported inputs in the CPI basket — around
30%. That tends to take place gradually, with annual inflation
affected for around four years after the change in import
prices.(3)
There is evidence that the pass-through of import prices to
consumer prices is occurring more rapidly than on average in
the past, which will have supported profit margins. As a result,
although the response of import prices to the depreciation in
sterling has been less than on average over the past, the CPI
has risen by a little more than its average response. Moreover,
inflation among import-intensive components of the CPI —
those components that are imported or have a high share of
imported inputs, such as food — has picked up particularly
sharply (Chart 4.8). There are signs that cost pressures further
back in the supply chain have moderated, in part as the fall in
sterling is passed on, though indicators of companies’
expected output prices — which capture the price of
intermediate inputs into consumer goods and services —
remain elevated.

Section 4 Costs and prices 31
4.3 Domestic cost pressures
While external cost pressures are set to wane over the next
couple of years, the absorption of slack in the domestic
economy (Section 3) means that domestic cost pressures are
likely to build to more normal levels.
The largest domestic cost facing most companies is the cost of
labour. The degree to which those costs affect inflation will
depend on growth in unit labour costs (ULCs) — the labour
costs associated with producing a unit of output. ULC growth
will reflect wage growth, alongside growth in the other labour
costs facing companies, and how both of those evolve relative
to growth in productivity.
Despite the continued fall in unemployment (Section 3), pay
growth remains subdued. In the past, lower unemployment
has typically been associated with higher pay growth
(Chart 4.9), as it becomes more difficult for companies to
recruit and retain employees.(1) Average weekly earnings
(AWE) pay growth increased only a little in the three months
to August, however, with annual growth in regular pay,
excluding bonuses, at 2.3% in the private sector and 2.1%
across the whole economy (Table 4.B). Pay growth for those
on lower wages appears to have been somewhat higher in the
year to 2017 Q2, according to the latest Annual Survey of
Hours and Earnings, probably reflecting the effects of the
National Living Wage.
Much of the weakness in pay growth in recent years will have
reflected weak productivity growth (Section 3), reducing the
drag on companies’ cost pressures. Consistent with that, ULC
growth (Chart 4.10) has been much less subdued than wage
growth, relative to their past averages. Recent upward
revisions by the ONS to the size of companies’ pension
contributions as well as downward revisions to productivity
growth (Section 3) mean that ULC growth is now estimated to
have been higher over the past few quarters than at the time
of the August Report.
One specific factor that may have weighed on both wage and
productivity growth in recent quarters — and so limited the
impact of weak wage growth on domestic cost pressures — is
changes in the composition of the workforce.(2) Bank staff
estimate that the growth in employment in the four quarters
to 2017 Q2 has been disproportionately in occupations and
industries typically associated with lower wages. If growth in
employment is being driven by those earning less than the

average wage, then that will push down measured average
wage growth, even if the wage growth of those already in
work is unchanged.
This recent shift in the composition of labour is estimated to
account for around 0.7 percentage points of the weakness in
pay growth in Q2 (Chart 4.11), although there is considerable
uncertainty around this estimate. To the extent that the
impact on pay growth of those compositional effects reflects a
relatively lower level of productivity, measured productivity
growth would be expected to be commensurately lower
(Section 3). As a result, ULC growth, and hence domestic
labour cost pressures, will have been much less affected.
Wage growth is projected to increase gradually over 2018, as
the tightening labour market starts to put more widespread
upward pressure on wage demands and as productivity growth
recovers somewhat. Although most survey indicators suggest
that wage growth is likely to remain modest in the near term,
there are some signs that wage demand pressures have
increased. Churn in the labour market has remained robust
over recent quarters, with the proportion of people moving
from one job to another close to its pre-crisis rate
(Chart 4.12). That could suggest continued confidence among
employees in their labour market prospects, which may place
pressure on businesses to retain staff by increasing wages.
Consistent with that, the REC survey continues to suggest
wage growth has risen for new recruits (Table 4.B). And the
Bank’s Agents also report a greater willingness among
companies to increase pay growth, relative to earlier in the
year, particularly for new recruits and key staff. Perhaps acting
against that, another factor that may have been influencing
pay decisions recently is companies’ uncertainty around the
economic outlook. This could affect their willingness to raise
pay at a faster pace until they have more clarity about future
demand for their output.
ULC growth is expected to have slowed in Q3 (Chart 4.10),
reflecting the effect of higher pension contributions in
2016 H2 starting to drop out of the annual comparison and
reducing the contribution from non-wage costs. Further
ahead, the gradual recovery in pay growth, alongside an
increase in non-wage costs — as the phasing in of automatic
enrolment in workplace pension schemes continues — and
continued weak productivity growth, means that ULC growth
is projected to rise from mid-2018 (Section 5).
4.4 Inflation expectations
Inflation expectations may influence wage and price-setting
behaviour. For example, if companies and households become
less confident that inflation will return to the MPC’s 2%
target, that may lead to changes in wage and price-setting
that make inflation persist above the target for longer.

Section 4 Costs and prices 33
The MPC monitors a range of indicators — derived from
financial market prices and surveys of households and
companies — to assess whether inflation expectations remain
consistent with its target. Most of these indicators suggest
that inflation expectations were broadly unchanged in the
latest data (Table 4.C) and were consistent with a return to
the target over coming years. Indicators of long-term inflation
expectations remain around their past averages. And
indicators of shorter-term inflation expectations — which tend
to respond more to changes in actual inflation and the
near-term outlook — have also been broadly stable, despite
the recent further pickup in CPI inflation.
Overall, the MPC judges that inflation expectations remain
well anchored, and that indicators of medium-term inflation
expectations continue to be broadly consistent with a return
of inflation to the 2% target.

34 Inflation Report November 2017
5 Prospects for inflation
CPI inflation has risen further above the 2% target as companies pass on the higher costs stemming
from the lower level of sterling. Unemployment has continued to fall and the extent of spare
capacity in the economy now seems limited. Moreover, the pace at which the economy can grow
without generating inflationary pressure has fallen over recent years. Over the MPC’s forecast
period, conditioned on a path for Bank Rate that rises to 1% by the end of 2020, demand is
projected to grow at a pace that uses up the remaining slack in the economy. As imported
inflationary pressures wane, domestic pressures build. Inflation is projected to remain slightly
above the 2% target at the three-year point. At its meeting ending on 1 November 2017, the MPC
voted to increase Bank Rate to 0.5%.
Growth over the past year has been supported by resilient
consumer confidence (Chart 1.2), the stronger world economy
(Chart 1.1), the small loosening in fiscal policy relative to
previous plans and the MPC’s comprehensive package of
measures in August 2016. Credit conditions facing
UK households (Chart 1.14) and companies (Chart 1.11) have
eased further, and exporters have also benefited from a lower
level of sterling. Unemployment has fallen to a 42-year low
and the level of remaining slack is limited. CPI inflation has
risen above the MPC’s 2% target as expected, as the sharp fall
in sterling has begun to pass through into consumer prices.
Over the past few months, market expectations for the path
of Bank Rate have risen. The MPC’s projections, summarised
in Table 5.A, are conditioned on a path that implies a gradual
rise in Bank Rate to 1.0% by the end of 2020, and is around
¼ percentage point higher than that in the August 2017
Report (Table 5.B).(1) The exchange rate has been volatile but
starts the projection at a similar level to August. Overall,
there is a little less monetary stimulus in these projections
than assumed in August.
The 18% decline in sterling since late 2015 largely reflects
financial market participants’ judgements about the impact of
Brexit on the United Kingdom. Those judgements depend on
assumptions about the United Kingdom’s trading relationships
after Brexit and about the transition to those arrangements.
(1) Unless otherwise stated, the projections shown in this section are conditioned on:
Bank Rate following a path implied by market yields; the stock of purchased gilts
remaining at £435 billion and the stock of purchased corporate bonds remaining at

three of which are financed by the issuance of central bank reserves; the
Recommendations of the Financial Policy Committee and the current regulatory plans
of the Prudential Regulation Authority; the Government’s tax and spending plans as
set out in the 2017 March Budget; commodity prices following market paths; and the
sterling exchange rate remaining broadly flat. The main assumptions are set out in a

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 35
As in previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned
on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the
United Kingdom’s trading relationship with the European
Union. They also assume that households and companies base
their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to
those new trading arrangements.
The outlook for UK growth is set against a backdrop of strong
global growth (Key Judgement 1), with recent data pointing to
more momentum than had been projected in August. That
strength, along with the lower sterling exchange rate, supports
UK trade (Key Judgement 2). Business investment is projected
to grow at a moderate pace but by less than would have been
suggested by global demand and financial conditions alone, as
uncertainty around Brexit weighs on companies’ plans.
Household spending growth has slowed as higher import costs
have squeezed real incomes. Real income and spending
growth are projected to recover gradually as nominal pay
growth picks up and imported inflation falls back. Overall,
demand growth is projected to remain modest over the
forecast period (Chart 5.1).
The pace at which the economy can grow without generating
inflationary pressure has fallen relative to pre-crisis norms.
This reflects persistent weakness in productivity growth and,
more recently, the more limited availability of labour. That
means modest demand growth uses up the little spare
capacity remaining in the economy over the forecast period
(Key Judgement 3). As a result, domestic inflationary
pressures are judged likely to build as the boost from imported
inflation diminishes (Key Judgement 4). Inflation is projected
to peak at around 3¼% in October, a bit higher than expected
three months ago (Chart 5.3), before falling back to end the
forecast period slightly above the 2% target (Chart 5.2).
At its meeting ending on 1 November 2017, the MPC voted to
increase Bank Rate to 0.5%, to maintain the stock of sterling
non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion
and to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at
£435 billion. The factors behind that decision are set out in
the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and
in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.(1) The remainder
of this section sets out the MPC’s projections, and the risks
around them, in more detail.
5.1 The MPC’s key judgements and risks
Key Judgement 1: global growth remains strong
Global growth has picked up significantly over the past year
across advanced and emerging economies. Moreover,

Chart 5.1 GDP projection based on market interest rate
expectations, other policy measures as announced
The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b). To the left of the vertical dashed line,
the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past; to the right, it
reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future. If economic circumstances
identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that
the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of
those occasions. The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within
each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast
period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of
100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere
outside the green area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the
light grey background. See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a
fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.
36 Inflation Report November 2017
strengthening indicators of global investment, such as capital
goods orders, suggest that growth is becoming more broadly
based.
The pickup has been particularly marked in the euro area
(Section 1), where considerable spare capacity had built up
earlier this decade. Monetary stimulus, together with
improving credit conditions and confidence, has led output to
grow above its potential rate and some of that slack to be
absorbed. The outlook for growth depends in part on how
much slack is left.
Unemployment has fallen significantly from its peaks in all
euro-area countries but remains above pre-crisis rates in most.
Recent outturns for wages show less upward pressure on pay
from those falls in unemployment than might have been
expected, suggesting that the equilibrium unemployment rate
may have fallen. In part, that is likely to reflect structural
reforms to labour markets in several countries. Given that,
together with evidence on broader indicators of labour market
conditions, the MPC judges that there is still significant slack
to be absorbed in the euro area. That means that growth can
continue at around current rates in the near term, before
falling back towards potential further out, a higher projection
than that of three months ago (Chart 5.4).
Recent data also point to slightly stronger US GDP growth in
the near term than previously expected (Section 1). Growth is
projected to slow to around its potential rate over the forecast
period (Table 5.C). Elsewhere in the world, there has been
little news to change the MPC’s projections. In China, growth
is still projected to slow towards 6% over the next three years.
Alongside this, credit is expected to continue to grow at a
rapid pace and significant risks to financial stability are
expected to remain. Growth in other emerging economies has

Chart 5.2 CPI inflation projection based on market
interest rate expectations, other policy measures as
announced
Charts 5.2 and 5.3 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future. They have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b). If economic circumstances identical to today’s
were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan charts are constructed
so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the
fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey
background. See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

recovered over the past year or so and is projected to remain
steady over the forecast period.
Based on PPP weights, global activity is projected to expand at
3¾% in 2018 before slowing a touch to 3½% (Table 5.C).
Weighted by UK export shares, growth is around 2¾%,
slowing to 2¼% by 2020. That is a slightly higher projection
than three months ago, reflecting the stronger outlooks for
the euro area and United States. The risks around the
projection are judged to be balanced.
Key Judgement 2: investment and net trade support
UK demand, while consumption growth remains subdued
UK growth has been modest in recent quarters and its
composition has rotated towards net trade and business
investment and away from consumption (Section 2). That
pattern continues over the forecast period as households
continue to adjust to lower levels of real income.
The combination of the stronger global economy and the
lower sterling exchange rate is supporting UK exports. Given
weaker domestic demand, imports have grown more
sluggishly than exports and net trade has supported
UK growth over the past year. Over much of the forecast
period, that support continues, consistent with the strength in
world demand relative to that in the United Kingdom and the
lower exchange rate. As in previous Reports, both exports and
imports grow relatively slowly compared with their historical
relationships with demand and the exchange rate, as
companies here and abroad begin to adjust trading
relationships in light of the United Kingdom’s vote to
withdraw from the European Union (Table 5.D).
The latest data show somewhat stronger UK business
investment growth over the past year than previously
estimated. Over the recent past and during the forecast
period, business investment is supported by external demand,
the limited spare capacity in firms and the continuing low cost
of finance (the box on pages 18–21 discusses the sensitivity of
companies to higher interest rates). Investment growth is,
however, more modest than would have been expected given
these conditions alone — probably as a result of the drag on
companies’ investment plans from the anticipation of and
uncertainty around Brexit, as suggested by a range of survey
evidence and contacts of the Bank’s Agents. Overall, business
investment is projected to grow at a little above current rates
(Table 5.D) and to end the forecast well below levels
projected prior to the referendum.
Households’ spending depends on their incomes and also on
their decisions on saving and borrowing. Household real
income growth has slowed sharply over the past year largely
as a result of the increase in inflation associated with sterling’s
depreciation (Key Judgement 4). Aggregating across all
households, income growth has been supported by solid

growth in employment. Over the forecast period, real wage
growth rises gradually as nominal pay growth picks up and
imported inflation falls back (Key Judgement 4), although
there is less support to aggregate income from employment
growth.
Changes in interest rates affect both current incomes and the
incentive to spend today rather than in the future. The MPC’s
November projection is conditioned on a path for Bank Rate
that rises to around 1% in three years’ time. Higher interest
rates raise interest income for those with deposits and raise
interest payments for those with loans. As set out in the box
on pages 18–21, although there is uncertainty about the
impact of higher rates, there is little reason to expect the
impact of a rate rise to be greater than in the past. Household
debt to income has fallen back from its 2008 peak, while
deposits have risen relative to income. Around 60% of the
stock of mortgages is at fixed rates, a higher proportion than
when interest rates were raised in the past. People holding
those mortgages will only face changes in their interest
payments when the fixed term of their deal ends. Moreover,
past falls in credit spreads (Section 1) mean that current
fixed-rate deals are lower than those prevailing two to five
years ago. Someone moving from an expiring five-year deal to
a new one could see rates fall by roughly 200 basis points and
for two-year deals the fall in rates could be around
30 basis points. Evidence from the latest NMG survey
suggests that the proportion of households with particularly
high debt-servicing ratios, who might be more likely to cut
spending markedly in the face of an income shock, remains
well below pre-crisis average levels. It would probably take a
further rise of around 1½ percentage points in interest rates
before this proportion returned to its pre-crisis average of 2%,
even assuming no rise in nominal incomes.
Consumption growth has slowed over the past year as
households have begun to adjust spending to the lower level
of income implied by the fall in sterling. Annual consumption
growth is projected to slow a little further next year, as
households continue to adjust to past falls in real wages, with
annual growth then rising back to 1½% by the end of the
forecast period (Table 5.D). In the central projection, the
saving ratio is broadly flat (Chart 5.5) and consumer credit
growth continues to slow from current high rates. It is
possible that households will want to maintain a higher rate of
spending in the near term despite weakness in their income,
implying a declining saving ratio. In the other direction,
households could increase saving or cut back borrowing if, for
example, they were to become more pessimistic or uncertain
about their income prospects.
The housing market is also sensitive to households’ views of
their income prospects and the path of interest rates. House
price inflation has slowed over the past year, but recent
outturns have been a little above expectations three months

ago. Over the forecast period, house prices are projected to
continue to grow around current rates (Table 5.E). Housing
investment growth, which has been supported recently by
unusually strong housebuilding activity, is projected to slow
over 2018, as in August (Table 5.D).
Key Judgement 3: with little slack remaining and
diminished growth in potential supply, modest demand
growth is sufficient to restore domestic inflationary
pressure
The economy can only grow so fast without putting upward
pressure on inflation. That potential rate of growth will vary
over time. Since the financial crisis, the United Kingdom has
had significant spare capacity. That meant the economy could
grow at a fairly rapid pace without putting significant upward
pressure on inflation, as it did in 2014–15. As that spare
capacity is used up, however, growth at above potential rates
is likely to lead to more material upward pressure on inflation.
Table 5.E Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements
The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key
judgements. Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will
monitor a broad range of variables to assess the degree to
which the risks are crystallising. The table below shows
Bank staff’s indicative near-term projections that are
consistent with the judgements in the MPC’s central view
evolving as expected.

40 Inflation Report November 2017
Moreover, that potential rate now seems lower than in the
past, reducing the speed at which demand can grow
sustainably.
An important indicator of labour market slack is the
unemployment rate, which peaked at over 8% in 2011. It has
since fallen back to 4.3%, its lowest rate in 42 years and below
the MPC’s estimated equilibrium unemployment rate of
around 4½%. As set out in a box in the February 2017 Report,
there remains considerable uncertainty around this estimate.
Developments in output and inflation suggest that there may
be a little spare capacity in the economy. Taking all the
evidence together, the MPC judges that the output gap
narrowed over 2017, and by more than expected three months
ago.
With little slack remaining, the speed at which the economy
can grow will depend on the pace at which its supply capacity
expands. During the economic recovery, potential supply
growth was driven to an unusual extent by potential labour
supply rather than potential productivity. Growth in potential
labour supply reflected falling equilibrium unemployment and
high net inward migration flows (Section 3). More recently
potential labour supply growth has eased, and is projected to
remain stable over the forecast period, based on ONS
projections for population growth, which incorporate a further
fall in net inward migration flows (Section 3). That means
supply growth will be more reliant on productivity growth.
Productivity has barely grown over the past ten years,
compared with growth rates of around 2¼% a year on average
before then. The weakness in recent years in part reflects low
levels of investment and the resulting low growth in the
capital stock. It also reflects unusually weak growth in total
factor productivity (TFP), the efficiency with which companies
use their resources to produce output. The MPC, like other
forecasters, has repeatedly marked down its projected
recovery in productivity growth over recent years.
Firms’ anticipation of and response to post-Brexit trading
relationships are also likely to weigh on productivity growth.
Uncertainty is probably holding back investment
(Key Judgement 2). A need to reorientate production and
supply chains would be likely to weigh on TFP growth, as
would a reduction in openness. Taking all influences together,
potential productivity is projected to grow at around 1% a
year. Measured hourly productivity growth has been very
weak in recent quarters. It is projected to pick up above
potential as that weakness unwinds, before falling back
(Chart 5.6) towards its estimated trend rate.
The MPC judges that UK potential supply growth is likely to
remain modest over the forecast period at around 1½%.
With little spare capacity at the start of the forecast period,
that means that demand can grow only at a modest pace if

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 41
inflation is to return sustainably to the 2% target
(Key Judgement 4). Conditioned on market interest rates, any
remaining slack is judged likely to be used up by the end of the
forecast period.
Key Judgement 4: significant upward pressure on inflation
from import and energy prices eases over the forecast
period and domestic inflationary pressures build
Inflation has risen to 3% and is projected to peak at around
3¼% in October. Inflation has been above the MPC’s 2%
target since the start of 2017, reflecting upward pressure from
the depreciation of sterling and higher energy prices. The
speed at which inflation returns to the 2% target will depend
both on how quickly those upward pressures diminish and on
the extent of domestic inflationary pressures.
The sterling ERI remains 18% below its late-2015 peak. That
lower level of sterling has already led to a sharp rise in import
prices, with somewhat more to come through over the
forecast period (Chart 5.7). The rise in imported costs initially
squeezes profit margins for companies in UK consumer supply
chains (Section 4). That squeeze will unwind as companies
pass on higher costs into their prices, but that process is likely
to take several years to complete.
As companies have begun to pass on their higher costs, the
contribution of import prices to CPI inflation has risen sharply,
to nearly 1 percentage point. That contribution is expected to
remain elevated in coming quarters before beginning to fall
back in the second half of the forecast period. Below-average
contributions from petrol and domestic energy prices are also
projected to reduce inflation over the next 18 months or so.
The period of above-target inflation could be more persistent
if it leads households and companies to revise up their
expectations for inflation, and that feeds through to wage and
price-setting decisions. Indicators of medium-term inflation
expectations, however, remain consistent with the 2% target
(Section 4).
The rise in external cost pressures has come against a
backdrop of modest wage growth, even as the labour market
has tightened. That in part reflects the low rate of
productivity growth. The rise in productivity growth over the
forecast period should feed through to higher pay growth, but
both productivity and wage growth are likely to settle at lower
rates than typically seen before the crisis.
There are some tentative signs of wage growth picking up,
especially for new recruits (Section 4). With labour market
churn back to pre-crisis levels, that should feed through into
higher average pay growth over time. But there is still
uncertainty about how responsive pay will be to an
increasingly tight labour market. It is possible, for example,
that pressure in the labour market at a time of above-target

42 Inflation Report November 2017
inflation feeds through to wage growth more quickly than
assumed. In the other direction, uncertainty about the
outlook for demand and profitability could weigh on
companies’ pay decisions or workers’ willingness to search for
a new role.
Inflationary pressure depends on changes in wages, and other
labour costs such as pension contributions, relative to
productivity. Developments in unit labour costs have been
more consistent with a tightening labour market. Unit labour
costs have been growing at close to past average rates,
although that in part reflects a temporary boost from
non-labour costs, which has begun to unwind (Section 4). As
pressure on supply builds, unit labour cost growth is likely to
pick up again.
Conditional on market interest rate expectations, which
anticipate two additional rises in Bank Rate over the
three-year forecast period, the MPC judges that wage and unit
labour cost growth are likely to rise over the forecast period
(Tables 5.D and 5.C). In the central projection, CPI inflation is
judged likely to still be slightly above the 2% target at the
three-year forecast horizon.
5.2 The projections for demand,
unemployment and inflation
Based on the judgements above and the risks around them,
under the market path for Bank Rate and the assumption of an
unchanged stock of purchased assets, the MPC projects
four-quarter GDP growth to pick up from early next year and
settle around 1¾%. In the second half of 2017, quarterly GDP
growth is projected to be a little stronger than expected in
August, but 2017 calendar-year growth is just below the
August projection (Table 5.F) due to revisions to 2016 data. In
the medium term, the projection is a touch weaker than in
August (Chart 5.8), largely reflecting the rise in the yield curve
since then. Within demand, consumption growth is projected
to remain well below past average rates. But strong global
growth, together with the lower level of sterling, supports net
trade and investment. The risks around the central projection
are judged to be balanced, rather than skewed to the downside
as in August, reflecting a more balanced global outlook. That
projection assumes that households and companies base their
decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to the
United Kingdom’s new trading relationship with the
European Union.
The economy’s supply capacity is also projected to grow at a
relatively modest pace over the forecast period. The MPC
judges there to be a little less slack at the start of the forecast
period than in August, and that is used up by the end.
Unemployment is projected to remain around 42-year lows
(Chart 5.9), lower than projected in August (Table 5.A).

this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example,
it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on
unemployment in successive quarters. The fan begins in 2017 Q3, a quarter earlier than the fan
for CPI inflation. That is because Q3 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in
part on data for July and August. The unemployment rate was 4.3% in the three months to
August, and is projected to be 4.3% in Q3 as a whole. A significant proportion of this
distribution lies below Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment
rate. There is therefore uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart.

Chart 5.10 Inflation probabilities relative to the target
The November and August swathes in this chart are derived from the same distributions as
Charts 5.2 and 5.3 respectively. They indicate the assessed probability of inflation relative to
the target in each quarter of the forecast period. The 5 percentage points width of the swathes
reflects the fact that there is uncertainty about the precise probability in any given quarter, but
they should not be interpreted as confidence intervals.

The table shows projections for Q4 four-quarter CPI inflation. The figures in parentheses show the
corresponding projections in the August 2017 Inflation Report. Projections were only available to 2019 at
the time of the August Report. The projections have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A
footnote (b).
Section 5 Prospects for inflation 43
Inflation remains well above the MPC’s 2% target and is
projected to rise a little further in the near term, peaking
around 3¼% in October. Above-target inflation reflects the
impact of higher import prices following sterling’s
depreciation. Inflation is projected to fall back over 2018,
largely reflecting a declining contribution from energy prices.
Higher import prices are judged likely to take some time to
work fully through to CPI inflation. Although their effect
diminishes in the second half of the forecast period, they are
still pushing inflation above the target at the three-year point.
Domestic inflationary pressures build over the forecast period.
CPI inflation is judged likely still to be slightly above the
2% target at the three-year forecast horizon (Table 5.G). The
projection is a little lower than three months ago in the
medium term (Chart 5.10), reflecting the higher yield curve.
The risks around the inflation projection remain balanced
(Chart 5.11).
Charts 5.12 and 5.13 show the MPC’s projections under the
alternative constant rate assumption and an unchanged stock
of purchased assets. That assumption holds Bank Rate at
0.5% throughout the three years of the forecast period, before
it rises towards the market path over the subsequent three
years. Under that path, four-quarter GDP growth is projected
to pick up a little more than in the market curve projection,
slack to be eroded by the middle of the forecast period and
demand to then rise notably above potential supply.
Reflecting that greater pressure of demand on supply, inflation
would end the forecast period around 2½%, further above the
target than under the market path projection.

(a) Chart 5.11 represents the cross-section of the CPI inflation fan chart in 2019 Q4 for the
market interest rate projection. The grey outline represents the corresponding cross-section
of the August 2017 Inflation Report fan chart for the market interest rate projection.
The projections have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b).
The coloured bands in Chart 5.11 have a similar interpretation to those on the fan charts.
Like the fan charts, they portray the central 90% of the probability distribution.
(b) Average probability within each band; the figures on the y-axis indicate the probability of
inflation being within ±0.05 percentage points of any given inflation rate, specified to
one decimal place.

44 Inflation Report November 2017
Other forecasters’ expectations
This box reports the results of the Bank’s most recent survey
of external forecasters, carried out in October.(1) On average,
respondents expected four-quarter GDP growth to slow a little
further over the coming year, before picking up to just under
2% three years ahead (Table 1). Forecasters’ central
projections for the unemployment rate have, on average,
continued to decline, and are now similar to or slightly below
projections produced prior to the EU referendum (Chart A).
External forecasters’ central expectations for CPI inflation at
all horizons were, on average, lower than three months ago
(Table 1). And survey respondents, on average, put less weight
on inflation being 0.5 percentage points or more above the
target in two years’ time than they had three months ago
(Chart B).
External forecasters, on average, expected somewhat less
monetary stimulus over the next three years than they did at
the time of the August Report, broadly consistent with the
steepening of the market-implied path for Bank Rate
(Section 1 and Chart C). Respondents projected Bank Rate to
rise to 0.9% in two years’ time, compared with 0.7% in
August. As in August, almost all forecasters expected the
current stock of gilt and corporate bond purchases to remain
unchanged over the next three years.
