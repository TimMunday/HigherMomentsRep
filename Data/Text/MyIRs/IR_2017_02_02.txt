Inflation Report
February 2017
In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.
Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy,
including its objectives for growth and employment.
The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of
the Monetary Policy Committee. It serves two purposes. First, its preparation provides a
comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid
to our decision-making. Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the
reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect.
Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are
based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths
for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central
projections.
This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with
section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Monetary Policy Summary i
Monetary Policy Summary
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the
2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its
meeting ending on 1 February 2017, the Committee voted unanimously to maintain
Bank Rate at 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously to continue with the programme of
sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance
of central bank reserves, totalling up to £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously
to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central
bank reserves, at £435 billion.
As the MPC had observed at the time of the UK’s referendum on membership of the EU, the appropriate path for
monetary policy depends on the evolution of demand, potential supply, the exchange rate, and therefore inflation. The
Committee’s latest economic projections are contained in the February Inflation Report. The MPC has increased its
central expectation for growth in 2017 to 2.0% and expects growth of 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. The upgraded
outlook over the forecast period reflects the fiscal stimulus announced in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement, firmer
momentum in global activity, higher global equity prices and more supportive credit conditions, particularly for
households. Domestic demand has been stronger than expected over the past few months, and there have been
relatively few signs of the slowdown in consumer spending that the Committee had anticipated following the
referendum. Nevertheless, continued moderation in pay growth and higher import prices following sterling’s
depreciation are likely to mean materially weaker household real income growth over the coming few years. As a
consequence, real consumer spending is likely to slow.
In preparing the February Report, the MPC undertook its scheduled regular assessment of aggregate supply-side
conditions. Pay growth, although edging up, has remained persistently subdued by historical standards — strikingly so in
light of the decline in the rate of unemployment to below 5%. This is likely to have reflected somewhat stronger labour
supply than previously assumed and, therefore, the presence of a greater margin of slack in the labour market, restraining
wage increases. This updated assessment means that the stronger path for demand in the February projection is roughly
matched by higher supply capacity. Combined with the 3% appreciation of sterling and a somewhat higher yield curve
over the past three months, that results in a projected path of inflation that is similar to the one expected in November,
despite the stronger growth outlook.
The value of sterling remains 18% below its peak in November 2015, reflecting investors’ perceptions that a lower real
exchange rate will be required following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Over the next few years, a consequence of
weaker sterling is that the higher imported costs resulting from it will boost consumer prices and cause inflation to
overshoot the 2% target. This effect is already becoming evident in the data. CPI inflation rose to 1.6% in December and
further substantial increases are very likely over the coming months. In the central projection, conditioned on market
yields that are somewhat higher than in November, inflation is expected to increase to 2.8% in the first half of 2018,
before falling back gradually to 2.4% in three years’ time. Inflation is judged likely to return to close to the target over
the subsequent year. Measures of inflation compensation derived from financial markets have stabilised at around
average historical levels, having increased during late 2016 as concerns about a period of unusually low inflation faded.
Monetary policy cannot prevent either the real adjustment that is necessary as the UK moves towards its new
international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany it over the next few
years. Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the cost of higher

unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth. For this reason, the MPC’s remit specifies that in such
exceptional circumstances the Committee must balance the trade-off between the speed with which it intends to return
inflation to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. At its February meeting, the
MPC continued to judge that it remained appropriate to seek to return inflation to the target over a somewhat longer
period than usual, and that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to balance the demands of the
Committee’s remit.
As the Committee has previously noted, however, there are limits to the extent that above-target inflation can be
tolerated. The continuing suitability of the current policy stance depends on the trade-off between above-target
inflation and slack in the economy. The projections described in the Inflation Report depend in good part on three main
judgements: that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices broadly as expected, and without
adverse consequences for expectations of inflation further ahead; that regular pay growth does indeed remain modest,
consistent with the Committee’s updated assessment of the remaining degree of slack in the labour market; and that the
hitherto resilient rates of household spending growth slow as real income gains weaken. In judging the appropriate policy
stance, the Committee will be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding these and other factors. For instance,
if spending growth slows more abruptly than expected, there is scope for monetary policy to be loosened. If, on the
other hand, pay growth picks up by more than anticipated, monetary policy may need to be tightened to a greater degree
than the gently rising path implied by market yields. Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the
economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.
Section 1 Financial markets and global economic developments 1
1 Financial markets and global
economic developments
Since the November Report, there have been rises in government bond yields and equity prices
globally. Market contacts attribute these moves primarily to greater near-term momentum in
global activity growth and an anticipated expansion of US fiscal policy further ahead. Sterling has
been volatile, probably reflecting changing expectations of the form and impact of Brexit.
Developments in the US economy and financial markets
appear to have been important influences on asset prices and
activity in the rest of the world in recent months. Since the
November Report, there have been sharp rises in US long-term
interest rates (Chart 1.1) and US equity prices (Section 1.1).
Longer-term government bond yields have also risen in other
advanced economies.
Alongside anticipation of a more expansionary US fiscal
stance, market contacts suggest that those moves in asset
prices reflect building momentum in indicators of near-term
global activity growth (Chart 1.2). Quarterly UK-weighted
global GDP growth picked up to 0.5% in 2016 Q3 (Table 1.A)
and is expected to have risen further to 0.6% in Q4, a faster
rate than anticipated in November. That is consistent with the
rise in the global composite PMI output survey indicator. The
near-term outlook for global GDP growth is also stronger than
projected in November, mainly reflecting more momentum in
euro-area activity than expected and sharp rises in consumer
and business confidence (Section 1.2). Some other survey
indicators such as the global manufacturing and export orders
PMIs point to slightly stronger global activity growth and so
suggest an upside risk to the outlook. Further ahead, the
projections for US and global GDP growth are also somewhat
stronger than three months ago (Section 5).
Both headline and core inflation had been subdued in many
countries in recent years (Table 1.B). But the pickup in global
commodity prices over 2016 (Section 4) is now being reflected
in rises in headline inflation, and the pickup in global growth
should provide further support to inflation.
Developments in global demand and inflation will affect the
quantities (Section 2) and prices (Section 4) of UK exports and
imports. And developments in global asset prices will affect
UK asset prices and credit conditions for UK firms and
households (Section 1.4). Sterling has been volatile and,
according to market contacts and event studies, it has been
sensitive to changing perceptions of the United Kingdom’s
likely future trading relationships following Brexit. In the
run-up to the February Report, it was 3% higher than at the

time of the November Report. UK market interest rates have
picked up a little, which is likely to feed through gradually to
higher interest rates for households and companies.
1.1 Developments in the United States
The market-implied path for US short-term interest rates has
steepened markedly since the US presidential election in early
November (Chart 1.3). On 14 December, the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the
federal funds rate from between ¼% and ½% to between
½% and ¾%. That was in line with market expectations, and
came against a backdrop of continued strengthening in US
economic activity and the labour market. The median of
FOMC members’ expected future paths for interest rates was
revised up slightly, and now reaches 2.9% by the end of 2019.
The path implied by market interest rates has risen more
substantially, reaching 1.9% in three years’ time, compared to
1.0% at the time of the November Report — closing some of
the gap with the median FOMC members’ path.
Alongside the rise in US short-term interest rates, the
US dollar (Chart 1.4), equity prices (Chart 1.5) and long-term
forward interest rates have also risen. For example, the
implied cost of US government borrowing five to ten years
ahead has risen by 0.8 percentage points since November (the
US diamond in Chart 1.6).
Changes in long-term interest rates will reflect both changes
in expected policy rates over that horizon and so-called ‘term
premia’. Term premia represent the additional compensation
that investors require for holding long-term bonds, and will
reflect investors’ preferences and perceptions of the risk
around the paths of future interest rates and inflation.
Model-based estimates of those term premia suggest that
they, rather than changes in expected policy rates, account for
most of the rise in long-term forward rates in the
United States since November (Chart 1.6), having been
unusually compressed earlier in 2016.
The rise in term premia could partly reflect reduced
perceptions of the risk of a prolonged period of very weak
US GDP growth and low inflation. Indeed, the prices of
inflation-linked bonds suggest that the rise in US rates has
reflected both a pickup in inflation compensation and a rise in
real interest rates (Chart 1.7). Despite their rise, long-term
interest rates are only back to around their 2014 levels and
remain substantially below their average levels in recent
decades (Chart 1.1).(1)
Although quarterly US GDP growth fell back from 0.9% in
2016 Q3 to 0.5% in Q4 (Table 1.A), that largely reflected the

unwind of an erratic boost from net trade in Q3. Employment
growth has remained robust and the unemployment rate has
fallen further. At 4.7% in December, it was slightly below the
median projection of FOMC members for the longer-run
unemployment rate. Despite that fall in unemployment,
four-quarter growth in wages, as measured by the
Employment Cost Index, has been broadly stable in recent
quarters, and was 2.3% in 2016 Q4.
Quarterly US GDP growth is projected to pick up to 0.6% in
2017 Q1 (Table 1.C), broadly consistent with the strength in
survey indicators of output growth (Chart 1.2) as well as
measures of consumer and business sentiment, which have
risen sharply (Chart 1.8). Growth should also be supported by
a pickup in productivity growth and by fiscal stimulus in
coming years. But higher market interest rates and the
stronger dollar are likely to offset some of that support. In
addition, there is considerable uncertainty over the size and
composition of any fiscal stimulus, and over the policies of the
new administration more broadly (Section 5).
1.2 Developments in the euro area
Government bond yields in the euro area have risen alongside
those in the United States. Ten-year German government
bond yields, for instance, have risen by 0.4 percentage points
since the November Report, around half of the increase in the
United States (Chart 1.1). While that rise is likely in part to
reflect greater near-term momentum in euro-area activity
growth (Chart 1.2), it is also likely to reflect the fact that
investors see these assets as close substitutes for one another.
Government bond yields in some euro-area countries,
including France, have picked up by more than those in
Germany (Chart 1.9), although they remain well below levels
in 2013–15. Alongside this, there has been a slight fall in the
euro (Chart 1.4). Market contacts suggest that these
developments largely reflect political uncertainty ahead of
elections in 2017, including in France.
An additional factor affecting asset prices has been the
European Central Bank’s announcement on 8 December that it
will extend its asset purchase scheme to December 2017,
albeit with the rate of purchases reduced from €80 billion per
month to €60 billion per month from April. While the path for
short-term interest rates has shifted up since November, it
remains very low (Chart 1.3).
The easing in monetary policy in the euro area over the past
few years has reduced the interest rates facing households and
companies, and so has been one factor supporting GDP
growth. Quarterly GDP growth rose to 0.5% in 2016 Q4, from
0.4% in Q3 (Table 1.A), higher than expected at the time of
the November Report and slightly higher than average growth
in recent years.

4 Inflation Report February 2017
The overall extent of slack — the balance between demand
and potential supply — remaining in the euro area is likely to
be fairly large. A key element of that is slack in the labour
market. Employment growth has picked up to around its past
average rate (Chart 1.10) and the unemployment rate has
fallen from 12% three years ago to 9.6% in December 2016.
That suggests that the degree of labour market slack has
narrowed. Nevertheless, four-quarter euro-area wage growth
has remained weak, at 1.3% in 2016 Q3, suggesting that there
may be additional slack remaining in other aspects of the
labour market. For instance, having fallen sharply during the
crisis, average hours worked have not recovered.
The persistent weakness in wage growth, and thus subdued
labour cost growth for firms, has been one factor behind the
continued low rate of inflation in the euro area. Both headline
and core inflation remain below past averages (Table 1.B).
Headline inflation has, though, picked up sharply in recent
months, to 1.8% in January. That largely reflects the
diminishing drag from past falls in commodity prices, and
recent commodity price increases feeding through.
In the near term, quarterly euro-area GDP growth is projected
to remain at around ½% (Table 1.C), stronger than projected
in November. That is broadly consistent with the strength in
the composite PMI indicator of output growth (Chart 1.2), as
well as in survey measures of consumer and business
confidence, which have picked up sharply (Chart 1.8). Activity
is expected to continue to be supported by monetary policy,
as well as by a somewhat more expansionary fiscal stance and
stronger global demand for exports than at the time of the
November Report. Recent rises in longer-term interest rates
are likely to offset that support to some degree, however.
1.3 Developments in emerging markets
Four-quarter growth in China has been stable in recent
quarters and was 6.8% in 2016 Q4 (Table 1.A). Indicators of
activity point to continued robust growth in the near term.
But, as discussed in the November 2016 Financial Stability
Report, domestic demand growth appears to have become
increasingly underpinned by credit growth. That poses risks to
the medium-term sustainability of the pace of GDP growth
and the Chinese authorities’ attempts to rebalance the
economy towards domestic demand. Annual growth in total
social financing — a broad measure of private sector credit
provision — was 13% in December, and the non-financial
sector debt to GDP ratio was estimated by the Institute
of International Finance (IIF) to be 255% in Q3, around
100 percentage points higher than in 2008. Financial
conditions have, however, tightened slightly since the
November Report, with rises in short-term interest rates. And
annual house price inflation, while remaining rapid, slowed
slightly in December. But inflationary pressures more broadly

Section 1 Financial markets and global economic developments 5
in China appear to have risen, with a sharp pickup in producer
price index inflation to 5.5% in December.
An acceleration in capital outflows from China could pose a
risk to domestic demand and financial conditions. Data from
the IIF indicate that following an easing in net private sector
capital outflows from China in 2016 H1, they accelerated again
in H2 (Chart 1.11). Since November, the renminbi has fallen
against the dollar, despite intervention by the authorities
and some decline in official foreign exchange reserves. In
response, the authorities have placed restrictions on
domestic households’ and corporates’ overseas transfers and
investments.
Having slowed significantly in recent years, GDP growth in
other emerging market economies (EMEs) has been broadly
stable since the November Report. In particular, Russia and
Brazil, which have accounted for much of the slowing in recent
years, appear to be emerging from recession. Growth in many
EMEs has also been supported by an easing in financial
conditions since early 2016 and, for some, the rise in
commodity prices (Section 4). Furthermore, many EMEs have
reduced their reliance on external finance, with current
account deficits falling.
These factors, together with stronger global demand, mean
that overall EME growth in the near term is projected to pick
up modestly. But downside risks to the outlook remain,
particularly related to credit growth in China. Furthermore,
debt levels in EMEs more broadly remain high and issuance of
dollar-denominated debt has increased among some EMEs in
recent years. The rise in US interest rates and falls in EME
currencies against the dollar (Chart 1.4) will have increased
the domestic currency cost of servicing that debt, which could
exert a further drag on EME activity.
1.4 Developments in sterling financial
markets and credit conditions
Exchange rates
Global developments are one influence on UK asset prices,
but asset prices will also reflect domestic developments.
Sterling has been volatile and in the run-up to the
February Report it was 3% higher than at the time of the
November Report (Chart 1.4). Market intelligence and event
studies suggest that sterling has been sensitive to changing
perceptions of the United Kingdom’s future trading
relationships following Brexit and their implications for the
economy. Implied volatilities from sterling options prices — a
market-based measure of perceived risk — continue to point
to a heightened degree of uncertainty around the outlook for
sterling.

6 Inflation Report February 2017
Interest rates
The market-implied path for UK short-term interest rates has
risen slightly (Chart 1.3). Market contacts ascribe that rise, in
part, to recent robust UK macroeconomic data (Section 2).
They also cite the change in the MPC’s communications in
November — in particular that ‘monetary policy can respond
in either direction’. The MPC voted to make no changes to
monetary policy at its December meeting, as set out in the
box on page 7. The details of the February decision are
contained in the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of
this Report, and in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.
Longer-term UK interest rates have also risen (Chart 1.1).
While the moves have been smaller than those in the
United States, the increase in UK long-term forward rates
similarly appears to be accounted for mostly by an increase in
term premia (Chart 1.6). That could reflect the perceived
reduction in the risk of a prolonged period of weak global GDP
growth (Section 1.1) and the interconnectedness of global
financial markets; investors tend to see advanced-economy
government bond yields as close substitutes.
In contrast to the United States and euro area, however, the
inflation compensation component of long-term forward
interest rates — one measure of long-term inflation
expectations — has been broadly stable since November
(Chart 1.7) at around its past average rate, although it is
higher than at the time of the August Report. The box on
pages 30–31 discusses developments in indicators of
UK inflation expectations in more detail.
Corporate capital markets
UK equity prices have increased since the November Report,
with the FTSE All-Share index 3% higher (Chart 1.5). That is in
part likely to reflect a reduction in risk premia, as well as a
small upward revision to expected corporate earnings, in
response to higher expected global and domestic growth.
The cost of issuing corporate bonds for companies will reflect
government bond yields (Chart 1.1), as well as the additional
compensation or ‘spread’ that investors require for the relative
riskiness of the company. The spreads on investment-grade
sterling corporate bonds have been broadly stable since the
November Report (Chart 1.12), and so the rise in government
bond yields will have pushed up the cost of corporate bond
finance for these companies. But the spreads on ‘high-yield’
bonds, those issued by riskier companies with lower credit
ratings, have fallen by more than the rise in government bond
yields, lowering the cost of debt for these companies. Those
falls have occurred alongside similar falls in high-yield spreads
in other advanced economies and market contacts suggest
that this reflects the improved outlook for global growth.

broadly, the MPC’s package of policy measures announced in

Section 1 Financial markets and global economic developments 7
Monetary policy since the November Report
The MPC’s central projection in the November Report was that
GDP was likely to grow at a moderate pace in the near term,
but then slow from the start of 2017, averaging 1½% over
2017–19. That reflected the anticipated impact of lower real
income growth on household spending, and uncertainty over
future trading arrangements that could restrain business
activity and supply growth over a protracted period. Largely
due to the depreciation in sterling, CPI inflation was expected
to rise above the 2% target during 2017 H1 and to reach
around 2¾% in 2018, before falling back gradually. That
central projection was conditioned on: the path for Bank Rate
implied by market interest rates; the announced
Term Funding Scheme; and the stock of purchased gilts and
corporate bonds reaching £435 billion and up to £10 billion
respectively and remaining there throughout the forecast
period. The last three elements would be financed by the
issuance of central bank reserves.
At its meeting ending on 14 December, the MPC noted there
had been little news in the domestic activity data since the
November Report, and a slowing in UK growth remained likely
during 2017. Although the near-term global outlook had
improved, in part reflecting expectations following the
US election of looser fiscal policy there, this was
counterbalanced by more elevated risks, which partly related
to the increased vulnerability in China to capital outflows.
CPI inflation had risen to 1.2% in November, and the
Committee expected inflation to rise to the 2% target within
six months, boosted in part by the rise in oil prices. The
sterling exchange rate had appreciated since the time of the
November Report and this by itself would point to less of an
overshoot in inflation relative to target in the medium term
than incorporated in the November projections. However,
month-to-month volatility in the exchange rate was to be
expected.
All Committee members judged it appropriate to leave the
stance of monetary policy unchanged. The MPC noted that
the path of monetary policy would continue to depend on the
evolution of prospects for demand, supply, the exchange rate
and therefore inflation. As a result, monetary policy could
move in either direction to ensure a sustainable return of
CPI inflation to the 2% target.
August is likely to have led to a slightly lower cost of capital
market finance for companies than would otherwise have been
the case. Under the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS),
the Bank has so far purchased £5.8 billion of corporate bonds,
and intends to purchase up to a further £4.2 billion. According
to some market contacts, the Scheme contributed to a sharp
pickup in corporate bond issuance in September. Issuance has
since fallen back somewhat, with market contacts attributing
that to the recent rise in longer-term interest rates.
Accordingly, overall net external finance raised by companies
in 2016 Q4 was lower than in Q3 (Table 1.D).
Bank funding costs and credit conditions
Capital markets also matter for broader credit conditions in
the economy through their influence on bank funding costs.
There has been a slight fall since November in the spread that
banks pay for funding over and above benchmark interest rates
(Chart 1.13). Some lenders have reported that the Term
Funding Scheme, by providing funding at close to Bank Rate,
may have contributed to the recent fall in funding spreads.
Benchmark interest rates, however, have risen since the
November Report by more than the fall in funding spreads.
And so, overall, there has been a slight increase in the cost of
bank funding since November, partially unwinding falls in bank
funding costs in previous quarters.
In response to the past falls in bank funding costs, the interest
rates on bank deposits and lending for households and
companies have fallen further over recent quarters

8 Inflation Report February 2017
(Chart 1.14). As recent increases in bank funding costs are
passed through, however, there is expected to be a gradual
increase in retail interest rates on lending to households and
companies.
Annual growth in aggregate lending has picked up steadily in
recent years (Chart 1.15). That in part reflects stronger
demand for credit, with lending growth in recent months also
likely to have been supported by the falls in interest rates since
the summer. Within aggregate lending, annual growth in
lending to companies has been broadly stable over 2016 at
around 3%, having increased in preceding years. Corporate
credit availability remains above normal according to
intelligence gathered by the Bank’s Agents. But there are
some signs from discussions with lenders that availability may
have tightened slightly for some sectors, such as commercial
real estate, while the Credit Conditions Survey suggests that
corporate credit demand has weakened. Growth in secured
lending to households has also stabilised over the past year, as
housing market activity has been subdued (Section 2).
There has, however, been a particularly robust recovery in
annual consumer credit growth, which reached 10.6% in
December (Section 2). Growth in consumer credit has become
more broad-based over the past year, having previously been
concentrated in dealership car finance. As well as robust
demand, the rapid growth in consumer credit is likely to reflect
strong competition, including on both price and non-price
terms. For example, the average interest rate on a £10,000
unsecured loan fell to 3.8% in December (Chart 1.14). And
there has been a marked lengthening in interest-free periods
on credit card balance transfers in recent years.
As the main source of money creation, the pickup in credit
growth over recent years is likely to have contributed to
the rise in aggregate broad money growth (Chart 1.16). Broad
money growth can provide a signal of future growth in
spending in the economy. But as discussed in the
November Report, the pickup in household money growth in
Summer 2016 occurred alongside a reduction in investment
fund holdings and so appeared to reflect a desire among
households to hold more liquid assets in the face of
heightened uncertainty around the time of the referendum.
Since November, growth in household money has slowed, as
flows into investment funds have recovered. Growth in
corporate money holdings has also eased over recent quarters.
That is likely to reflect a normalisation following a period of
strong growth between 2013 and early 2016.

Section 2 Demand and output 9
2 Demand and output
Output growth has been stable during 2016 at close to past average rates. Underpinning that,
consumption growth has been robust, though it is expected to slow as the rise in import prices
weighs on households’ purchasing power. Activity in the housing market has picked up slightly but
remains subdued. In contrast, investment has declined over the past year and, despite the
depreciation in sterling, net trade has dragged on GDP growth.
Growth in demand relative to potential supply (Section 3) is
an important determinant of inflationary pressure. Since the
vote to leave the European Union, a key issue continues to be
how much and how quickly demand and supply will be
affected by the process of Brexit. This section examines the
outlook for demand growth, drawing on the official output
and expenditure data and other indicators of activity and
spending.
Quarterly GDP growth was stable over 2016 (Chart 2.1).
Output growth, according to the preliminary estimate, was
0.6% in 2016 Q4, the same as in Q3, and growth is expected
to be unrevised in the mature estimate. Growth in Q4
continued to be driven mainly by activity in the service sectors
(Chart 2.2). While growth in consumer-focused service
output slowed, it was around its average pace over the past
two years, which is likely to have been associated with
continued robust growth in household spending (Section 2.1).
A fall in extraction output, reflecting the timing of
maintenance activity, weighed on growth in Q4. Excluding
extraction, output growth was slightly stronger than in Q3.
Output growth is projected to slow slightly to 0.5% in
2017 Q1. While survey indicators of expected output growth
have risen slightly, their levels remain consistent with a lower
rate of GDP growth in Q1 than reported by the official data for
2016 Q4 (Chart 2.3).
GDP growth has been markedly stronger since the middle of
2016 than projected in August, and stronger still than the
contraction in activity suggested by output indicators at the
time. Underpinning that, consumption growth appears to
have been robust. It is projected to slow in response to the
drag from higher import prices on households’ purchasing
power, though more gradually than previously projected
(Section 2.1). Housing market activity and housing investment
growth have been more resilient than expected, though still
subdued (Section 2.2). According to the latest data, business
investment growth has been weak, albeit somewhat less so
than expected, and it is projected to fall slightly in the near

term (Section 2.4). Net trade is expected to support growth in
the near term, reflecting the 18% depreciation in sterling since
November 2015 (Section 2.5).
2.1 Household spending
Consumption has continued to grow at a robust pace, as it has
done over the past two years (Table 2.A). This was broadly as
projected in November but slightly stronger than expected in
August. There is little sign of uncertainty having weighed on
consumption growth since the referendum.
Consumption is mainly determined by trends in income and
income expectations. While wage growth has been subdued,
increases in employment (Section 3) have pushed up
aggregate income growth in recent years. Households’
purchasing power has also been boosted by falls in food and
energy prices. Real income has grown broadly in line with past
averages since 2015, though it slowed slightly in 2016 Q3 as
the effect of those past falls in food and energy prices has
started to fade (Chart 2.4).
After strong growth in 2015 and 2016, quarterly growth in real
labour income is projected to slow to around zero this year
(Section 5), as higher import prices pass through to higher
consumer prices (Section 4). There are signs that households
are starting to anticipate this effect. For example, the GfK/EC
measure of households’ expected price increases has risen
(Chart 2.5). Despite this, households’ expectations of their
financial situation according to the same GfK/EC survey has
only softened slightly, except for a brief period around the
referendum, and remains above its past average. In addition
to strong income growth, confidence may have been
supported by rising asset prices over recent years (Section 1).
Consumption has grown somewhat faster than income in
recent quarters and, consistent with that, the saving ratio has
declined slightly (Chart 2.6). There is uncertainty about the
timing and extent to which consumption growth will respond
to the slowing in real income growth. One factor that affects
households’ decisions to save or spend out of their income is
their expectations for future income growth. For example, if
households expect the slowing in real income growth to be
temporary, they may choose to reduce their saving
temporarily rather than their spending growth.
Another factor that can influence household spending and
saving decisions is the availability and cost of credit. Although
as a proportion of consumption it remains small, consumer
credit growth has risen in recent years (Chart 2.7). Much of
that has been accounted for by growth in dealership car
finance. This is likely to have mainly reflected a shift in the
availability of dealership car finance and how households buy

cars.(1) Around four fifths of new cars were bought with
dealership finance in 2015, compared with half in 2009. At
least some of that is likely to have replaced other forms of
finance that would have otherwise been used to buy cars, such
as unsecured loans or savings, rather than leading to additional
car purchases. It is also likely to have represented an easing in
credit conditions and therefore supported spending to some
degree. As much of that shift in the way car purchases are
financed has now occurred, the strong contribution from
dealership finance to consumer credit growth is expected to
decline.
The most recent pickup in consumer credit growth has
reflected growth in credit card and other borrowing, such as
personal loans (Chart 2.7). That has occurred alongside
marked falls in interest rates on household borrowing in recent
years (Chart 1.14) and a lengthening in interest-free periods
on credit card balance transfers. While some of the increase in
borrowing may be matched by increased saving, the easing in
credit conditions is likely to have supported consumption
growth in recent years. And credit conditions are likely to
continue to support consumption in coming quarters.
Overall, consumption growth is projected to slow in coming
quarters, as real income growth slows. Nonetheless,
households are projected to adjust their spending growth
more gradually than that slowing in income growth, so that
the saving ratio falls.
2.2 The housing market
Credit conditions and income will also affect households’
decisions about whether to purchase a home. Activity in the
housing market will in turn affect housing investment, which
comprises three distinct components: around three quarters is
spending on new dwellings and improvements to existing
dwellings, with the remainder spent on services associated
with property transactions, such as estate agents’ fees.
Housing investment fell in 2016 Q3 (Table 2.A), driven by a
fall in spending associated with transactions. This is likely to,
at least in part, reflect the weakness in transactions in Q2 and
Q3 (Chart 2.8). As discussed in the May 2016 Report, the
pre-announced rise in stamp duty land tax in April 2016 led
some transactions that would otherwise have taken place later
in the year to be brought forward. That resulted in a sharp rise
in transactions in Q1 and a subsequent fall in April.
Transactions have risen from their April low (Chart 2.8) and,
while housing market activity remains subdued, it has been
somewhat stronger than expected in November. House price
inflation also picked up in Q4, having slowed over much of
2016. Uncertainty around the impact of Brexit on housing

demand appeared to weigh on price growth initially, but this
effect faded in the months following the referendum,
alongside the recovery in consumer confidence (Chart 2.5).
The average of the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices
rose by 6.6% on an annualised basis in the three months to
December, having risen by 2.4% in the three months to
September.
Housing market activity is projected to continue to increase
gradually in the near term. Mortgage approvals, a leading
indicator of transactions, have risen, and the RICS survey
balance for new buyer enquiries points to a further pickup in
activity.
Investment in new and existing dwellings was little changed in
2016 Q3, broadly as expected in November, and is projected
to remain broadly flat in coming quarters. Overall, housing
investment is projected to grow modestly in the near term,
largely reflecting a rise in transaction spending (Table 2.B).
2.3 Business spending
In November, most survey indicators of investment intentions
had declined (Chart 2.9) and measures of business uncertainty
remained elevated. Business investment was, therefore,
expected to have fallen (Table 2.B), but there was uncertainty
about the timing and extent of that fall.
In contrast to those indicators, the official estimate of business
investment rose slightly in Q3 (Table 2.A), although it
remained lower than a year earlier. Early investment data are
volatile and prone to significant revision.(1) Although survey
indicators are informative about underlying trends,
quarter-to-quarter movements, particularly in early estimates,
are hard to predict.
To the extent that underlying investment has been firmer than
expected, this could be due to a number of factors. The rise in
uncertainty may have weighed on investment less than it has
tended to in the past.(2) That could suggest a more positive
outlook for investment. Or it could be that those effects are
slow to influence spending, as firms take time to adjust their
investment plans. The effects of uncertainty may therefore
take longer to show up in investment than projected. In
particular, to the extent that uncertainty relates to the
long-term outlook following Brexit, investment in capacity to
supply near-term demand may not have been materially
affected.
Another reason uncertainty may have weighed on investment
less than in the past is the stability of credit conditions. In
contrast to past increases in uncertainty, which have typically

been accompanied by a marked tightening in credit conditions,
these have been broadly stable (Chart 2.10 and Section 1).
Companies’ spending can also be affected by developments in
the commercial real estate (CRE) market in a number of ways.
Investment spending on new and existing buildings and
transactions are a part of business investment. Moreover,
developments in the CRE market can affect business
sentiment and many firms use property as collateral for
borrowing. Activity in this sector was dampened, in part, by
uncertainty about the outlook for CRE demand following
Brexit. CRE prices and transactions fell somewhat ahead of
the referendum, and then further following the vote.(1) Since
then, conditions in the CRE market appear to have stabilised
and, therefore, the effect of this drag on investment growth
may have diminished.
A further influence on business spending could be the effect of
changes in companies’ defined-benefit pension fund deficits.
As explained in the box on pages 14–15, however, while this
may be an important influence for a small number of
companies, the data examined suggest that this is unlikely to
have materially affected aggregate investment growth.
Investment is projected to fall modestly in coming quarters
but by less than projected in November. Survey indicators of
investment intentions picked up in Q4 (Chart 2.9), but
suggest that investment growth will remain subdued,
especially in the service sector. Some respondents to the
Bank’s new Decision Maker Panel (DMP) Survey report that
heightened uncertainty is weighing on their investment plans
(see the box on page 16 for more information on this survey).
Other surveys with a longer history, such as the Deloitte CFO
Survey, also suggest that business uncertainty remained
elevated in Q4.
2.4 Government spending
The MPC’s forecasts are conditioned on the Government’s tax
and spending plans detailed in the Autumn Statement. While
the Government plans to continue to reduce the budget
deficit, public sector net borrowing over the next three years is
projected to fall more gradually than at the time of the
March 2016 Budget. That reflects two key factors: lower
expected GDP growth, which implies higher welfare payments
and lower tax receipts, and increased discretionary spending,
in particular infrastructure investment.
While the MPC’s forecasts in November accounted for the role
of slower GDP growth, they did not include the additional
measures announced. Fiscal policy is, therefore, projected to
provide a boost to GDP growth over the next three years
compared with the forecast in November (Section 5).

14 Inflation Report February 2017
Macroeconomic risks of defined-benefit
pension fund deficits
Defined-benefit (DB) pension funds invest upfront
contributions to provide pre-determined payments to
employees on retirement. A pension scheme is considered to
be in deficit when the value of its liabilities exceed that of its
assets. To calculate the current value of those assets and
liabilities, market values are typically used for assets and
future expected payments are often discounted using
long-term interest rates. The extent to which a scheme is in
deficit is therefore sensitive to movements in those interest
rates. As discussed in the box on pages 14–15 of the
November Report, the effect of changes in interest rates on
deficits will depend on how they affect asset prices compared
with the estimated value of liabilities. For example, falls in
interest rates associated with an easing in monetary policy will
typically boost the value of both assets and liabilities and,
therefore, funds starting from close to a balanced position will
generally remain so.
DB pension fund deficits have widened over recent years. The
proportion of employees covered by DB pension schemes has
declined, however, as these schemes have generally been
closed to new entrants.(1) Around 8% of private sector
employees are currently members of active DB pension
schemes. Many of those schemes are in relatively larger firms;
fewer than 1% of UK firms have outstanding claims from
active or closed DB pension schemes. While a small
proportion of the total, changes in DB pension fund deficits
could potentially have an impact on those companies’
spending decisions or solvency, which could in principle
influence aggregate business spending and the stability of
credit conditions. There is evidence to suggest that changes in
contributions to DB pension funds can affect the spending
decisions of those companies affected. But overall, given the
small proportion of firms with DB pension funds, the effect on
aggregate investment growth is estimated to be very small.
On 4 January, members of the Financial Policy Committee and
the Monetary Policy Committee met to discuss, and were
presented with material from ongoing work on, developments
in DB pension fund deficits and evidence of their potential
economic impacts. This box summarises the material
presented at that meeting.
The size and distribution of DB pension fund deficits
The most timely measure of aggregate DB pension fund
deficits is the monthly series published by the Pension
Protection Fund (PPF) — the PPF 7800 Index. On this
measure, deficits have narrowed notably in recent months but
remain wider than in the past (Chart A). While this measure is
timely it has some limitations. For example, the PPF 7800
does not account for firms’ contributions to their pension
schemes during the year or for some hedging activity. These
factors can lead to volatility in the series and revisions once
asset allocation data are updated each year. Moreover, the
measure of liabilities only reflects the PPF’s obligations to pay
out in the event of employer insolvency. The PPF pays 100%
of pensions that are already being received or where members
have reached retirement age and up to 90% in other cases.
The Pensions Regulator (TPR) assesses pension schemes at
least once every three years. Where a scheme is estimated to
be in deficit, a deficit reduction plan to close that gap will be
agreed with the firm. Despite the widening in deficits
indicated by the PPF 7800, contributions made by companies
as part of those deficit reduction plans and any additional
contributions more broadly have both been fairly stable in
recent years (Chart A).
Scheme-level data from TPR provide information on the
distribution of pension deficits across firms.(2) These data
show that pension deficits are concentrated among large
corporates, which account for three quarters of the total
(Chart B). But, for many of these large firms, pension deficits
are small relative to their assets.
Impact of DB pension deficits on investment
One way pension deficits might affect the wider economy is if
firms reduce their investment spending in order to increase
their pension contributions. Bank staff have examined
whether listed companies’ investment has been affected by
pension deficits using firm-level data from TPR for 2009 to
2014 matched to company accounts data.
(1) New staff increasingly join ‘defined-contribution’ pension schemes where the payouts
depend on the income earned on investment and are not pre-determined.
(2) Data for around 3,400 listed and non-listed firms, which account for over 90% of
aggregate private sector DB pension assets and liabilities.

Section 2 Demand and output 15
In addition to the changes to tax and spending plans, the
Government announced three new fiscal rules in the
Autumn Statement: cyclically adjusted net borrowing to be
less than 2% of GDP by 2020/21; public sector net debt to be
falling as a share of GDP in 2020/21; and an increase in the
cap on some welfare spending to £126 billion to apply in
2021/22. These rules replace the previous targets, which
included having a balanced budget by 2019/20.
2.5 Net trade and the current account
Abstracting from erratic factors, Bank staff estimate that net
trade subtracted around 0.3 percentage points from GDP
growth in 2016 Q3. While headline trade dragged on growth
more materially (Table 2.A), that reflected a large net import
of non-monetary gold. This component of trade is erratic and
only affects the composition of GDP growth — the
counterpart to that drag on growth is a boost to private sector
investment in valuables.
The fall in net trade, excluding erratic factors, in 2016 Q3
occurred despite the depreciation in sterling since
November 2015. That depreciation will support net trade
through two key channels — reducing domestic demand for
imports and supporting UK exports. As explained in the box
While investment is not found to be negatively associated
with the size of a firm’s pension deficit, it is found to be
slightly lower among those firms with larger deficit reduction
contributions. In aggregate though, this approach suggests
that deficit reduction plans only had a very small effect on
investment growth between 1996 and 2015. Bank staff
estimate that annual investment growth was on average less
than 0.1 percentage points lower over that period as a result of
pension contributions (Chart C). The estimated impact of
pension contributions on investment could reflect reduced
cash flows available for investment or perhaps higher funding
costs for companies with large deficits. However, this
approach does not account for the fact that contributions are
invested in financial assets, which may have lowered the cost
of finance for other firms and therefore supported investment.

The Decision Maker Panel Survey
In August 2016, in response to the significant uncertainty
around the impact of Brexit on companies’ decision-making,
the Bank launched a monthly survey of senior executives
called the Decision Maker Panel (DMP) Survey.(1) The panel
and questions have been designed in partnership with
Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University,
Professor Paul Mizen of the University of Nottingham and
colleagues from HM Treasury. This survey is based on a similar
collaboration in the United States between Professor Bloom
and the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank. The data collected will
facilitate research on the links between uncertainty and
company behaviour.
The DMP Survey asks panel members about developments in,
and the probabilities they ascribe to, a range of possible future
outcomes for changes in three areas: investment and
borrowing; employment and costs; and sales and prices.
Panel members are sent a monthly survey focusing on one of
these three topics on a rotating basis. The survey had
750 respondents in December and, while its full benefit will be
realised over time as a time series of responses becomes
available, it has already helped to inform the MPC’s
deliberations.(2)
As monitoring the impact of Brexit on firms is a key aim of the
DMP Survey, in December respondents were asked how they
expect their export revenues to be affected by Brexit. On
average, exporting panel members reported that they expect
only a small impact on export revenue, though they placed a
slightly greater weight on negative rather than positive
impacts (Table 1). Among firms expecting a negative effect,
some reported concern that their European customers are
already in the process of shifting to non-UK suppliers based in
the European Union. Among those expecting a positive effect,
some reported that they expected the depreciation in sterling
to support their exports.
Despite pointing to a generally positive outlook for sales over
the coming year, the survey suggests that companies are
uncertain about future prospects. While some firms report
that this uncertainty is weighing on their investment
intentions, on average respondents placed a 70% weight on
their investment spending rising over the coming year.

on pages 21–22 of the November Report, however, the timing
and size of these effects is uncertain and will depend on how
companies anticipate and respond to Brexit. Net trade is
projected to support GDP growth in the coming quarters.
Nominal trade flows, together with other payments between
the United Kingdom and the rest of the world, will be reflected
in the current account. The current account deficit widened in
Q3 (Chart 2.11). That reflected an increase in the nominal
trade deficit, driven mainly by the significant net import of
non-monetary gold. In contrast, the deficit on primary income
— the net value of investment income received by
UK residents — narrowed. As UK residents hold more foreign
currency assets than they have foreign currency liabilities, the
depreciation in sterling in Q3 will have supported investment
income in that quarter.
Despite the widening in the current account deficit in Q3, the
deficit was smaller than anticipated in November as the data
were revised materially in the latest release (Chart 2.11).
Much of that reflected upward revisions to direct investment
income and the nominal trade balance over the past. The
current account is expected to have narrowed in Q4, reflecting
both less negative trade and income balances.

Section 3 Supply and the labour market 17
3 Supply and the labour market
Employment growth has slowed although the unemployment rate has fallen a little further.
Unemployment is projected to remain somewhat above its equilibrium rate, the estimate of which
has been revised down since November as part of the MPC’s regular assessment of aggregate
supply-side conditions. Productivity growth is projected to be modest. Weak productivity and a
degree of slack in the labour market are projected to continue to weigh on wage growth, as the drag
from low inflation diminishes.
The outlook for GDP growth will be shaped by developments in
demand (Section 2) but also by the supply capacity of the
economy. That supply capacity depends on the amount of
available labour and how productively it can be put to use. The
MPC has reassessed its supply-side judgements in this Report.
There remains, however, considerable uncertainty around the
outlook for supply and the MPC will continue to reassess its
judgements periodically.
The balance between demand and supply — that is, the degree
of slack — is an important determinant of wage growth (see the
box on pages 18–20) and broader inflationary pressures
(Section 4). One clear symptom of slack following the financial
crisis was an elevated unemployment rate (Chart 3.1).
Although the unemployment rate has since fallen to below 5%,
wage growth has remained subdued (Table 3.A). Given the
persistence and extent of weak wage growth over the past
couple of years, the MPC now judges that the unemployment
rate can probably fall a little further before wage pressures build
sufficiently to keep inflation at the 2% target over the medium
term. There are risks in both directions to that central
judgement and a range of views among MPC members. Wage
growth is projected to pick up gradually as slack narrows and
the drag from past low inflation diminishes. The outlook for
wage growth will also depend on productivity growth, which is
judged likely to continue to be weak.
The unemployment rate is projected to rise slightly in the near
term (Chart 3.1) as labour demand softens. Flat employment in
the three months to November (Section 3.1) could suggest that
labour demand is already starting to weaken. But employment
growth can be volatile, and the unemployment rate has fallen a
little, while output growth has been firmer than expected.
The pace of output growth further ahead will in part depend on
potential supply growth. Potential supply cannot be directly
observed and the MPC therefore monitors a range of indicators
to assess the current level of supply and its likely evolution
(Section 3.2).

18 Inflation Report February 2017
Why has wage growth remained subdued?
Wages play a key role in households’ and businesses’
decision-making. As the primary source of income for most
households, the current level of wages and their expected
future growth will help shape households’ spending decisions
(Section 2). In aggregate, wages form the bulk of the domestic
costs of UK-based firms, and so developments will influence
both their spending and pricing decisions (Section 4).
Having averaged over 4% prior to the financial crisis, wage
growth appears to have settled at around 2%–3% over the
past two years. The MPC had expected falling unemployment
and firmer productivity growth to lead to a pickup in wage
growth (Chart A). The relatively stable growth in wages has
therefore tended to be some way below past projections
(Chart B).(1)
This box considers wage growth in the context of its key
underlying drivers, drawing on the broad range of analysis that
was presented to the MPC as part of its regular assessment of
aggregate supply-side conditions. Different explanations for
weak wage growth have different implications for broader
inflationary pressures. In aggregate, firms’ ability to pay higher
wages to their workers will depend on how productive the
workforce is; if matched by higher productivity, higher wages
might not affect the prices firms charge and hence inflation.
In contrast, wage growth may depend on how firms and
households expect other costs and prices to evolve; for
example, if households expect prices to rise more quickly that
could lead them to demand higher pay, which in turn could
lead to higher inflation if companies raise prices to fund it. In
addition, changes in slack — in particular changes in
unemployment — will affect both wages and inflation.
Productivity growth
One of the most important factors determining pay is
productivity — the amount of output produced per worker
— as this will determine, in large part, the amount of revenue
companies in aggregate have to pay their employees. While
wage and productivity growth can deviate in the short run,
they have tended to move together over time. It is, therefore,
perhaps not surprising that the recent weakness in wage
growth has occurred alongside weak productivity growth
(Section 3.2).
Wage growth relative to its pre-crisis rates has, however, been
even weaker than productivity growth (Chart C). That
suggests that other factors have also played a significant role
in explaining low wage growth. And by lowering pay relative
to productivity, those factors will have dampened growth in
firms’ costs and weighed on inflation (Section 4).
Inflation and nominal wages
One factor that may have contributed to the weakness in
wage growth over the past two years is the weakness in
external cost pressures. Falls in global food and energy prices
during 2014–15 boosted households’ purchasing power
(Section 2) and some contacts of the Bank’s Agents reported
that this reduced some of the pressure on companies to
increase wages.
The recent rise in import costs for companies following the
depreciation in sterling (Section 4) presents risks to the wage
projection in both directions. Firms could seek to offset the
reduction in their margins associated with those costs by
attempting to push down other costs, including wages.
Indeed, on balance, respondents to the Agents’ annual pay
survey reported that potential limits in their ability to pass on

cost increases to prices were expected to dampen growth in
pay settlements over 2017.(1) In contrast, to the extent that
companies pass higher import costs through to consumer
prices, that could put upward pressure on wages in the near
term if employees seek greater pay rises to reduce the hit to
their purchasing power.
Labour market slack
The persistent weakness in wage growth relative to
productivity growth in recent years suggests that weak
external cost pressures alone are unlikely to account for all of
it. Slack in the labour market also tends to lead to weaker
wage growth, since the easy availability of those looking for
work can reduce the bargaining power of the remaining
workforce. Indeed, wage growth was weak during 2010–13 as
unemployment remained relatively high (Chart D). Falls in
unemployment were then accompanied by a pickup in wage
growth, and that continued into 2015. Subsequent falls in
unemployment have not, however, been matched with rises in
wage growth.
That could suggest that the unemployment rate may be able
to fall further below pre-crisis rates before wage growth and
labour cost pressures build sufficiently to keep inflation at the
2% target. Or equivalently, that the so-called ‘equilibrium
unemployment rate’ is lower than prior to the crisis. Indeed, a
range of models that control for other factors such as weak
productivity growth and low inflation would suggest that the
equilibrium unemployment rate would need to have fallen to
somewhere between 4% and 4¾% to explain the MPC’s
forecast errors over 2013–16 (Chart B).
There are a number of factors that could have lowered the
equilibrium unemployment rate over the past decade. The
rising average age of the workforce and increased degree of
educational attainment are characteristics that have tended to
be associated with lower unemployment rates. In addition,
tax and benefit reforms over many years may have lowered
the equilibrium rate by increasing the incentive and ability to
move from unemployment to employment.(2)
One indicator of how well suited the pool of unemployed is to
the available jobs, and hence the equilibrium unemployment
rate, is how long those people have been out of work for. The
short-term unemployment rate has been below its pre-crisis
average for some time (Chart 3.5), which may indicate that
some of the newly unemployed have been able to move into
work more quickly than in the past. The share of the
workforce in long-term unemployment had been elevated in
recent years. That may have suggested they were finding it
harder to obtain work and hence placing less downward
pressure on wages, consistent with a higher equilibrium
unemployment rate. That long-term unemployment rate has,
however, continued to drift down and is now close to its
pre-crisis average. Such trends are perhaps consistent with
survey measures of recruitment difficulties, which have
remained close to or below their pre-crisis averages
(Table 3.B), even as the unemployment rate has fallen.
In addition, the rate at which employees are moving from
employment to unemployment, either due to redundancy or
for other reasons, has been below past average levels in recent

years. To the extent that those relatively low job separation
rates persist, that would also point to a lower equilibrium
unemployment rate. One model estimated by Bank staff that
takes into account both lower job separation rates and
particular characteristics of the labour force — including
education levels, demographics and how long people have
been unemployed for — would suggest that the equilibrium
unemployment rate could have fallen to 4¼%.
Previously the MPC’s best collective judgement was that the
equilibrium unemployment rate had remained close to its
pre-crisis rate of around 5%. Given developments in wage
growth, unemployment and recruitment difficulties over the
past year, however, the MPC now judges that the equilibrium
unemployment rate is more likely to be around 4½%. There
are risks in both directions to that central judgement and a
range of views among MPC members.
In addition to uncertainty around the degree of slack, there is
also uncertainty around the relationship between slack and
wage growth. It is possible that an increased ability to hire
people from abroad over the past decade could have reduced
the sensitivity of wage growth to domestic labour conditions
over time. In contrast, past increases in slack may still be
dampening wage growth at present. Following the financial
crisis and a prolonged period of slack, employees may be
reluctant to seek higher wages from their employers for fear of
a lack of alternative jobs. It is difficult to judge how long any
such scarring effects could persist.
The near-term outlook for wage growth
Wage growth will also be affected by increases in the National
Living Wage (NLW) and other costs related to employment.
As discussed in previous Reports, Bank staff estimate that the
introduction of the NLW is likely to add around 0.1 percentage
points to average annual wage growth over the next few years.
In contrast, higher non-wage costs associated with
employment, such as pension contributions, could dampen
wage growth if firms seek to limit the overall increase in their
labour costs. While such costs have risen broadly in line with
wages over the recent past (Section 4), the continued phasing
in of automatic enrolment in workplace pension schemes may
push costs up further, and the introduction of the
apprenticeship levy may also lead to an increase in
staff-related costs for some businesses.
Taken together, some degree of remaining slack in the
economy and only modest productivity growth are projected
to keep wage growth relatively subdued in the near term, as
the drag from past low inflation wanes. It is also possible that
higher bonus payments could raise aggregate wage growth
temporarily following recent strength in profits, although this
would have limited implications for companies’ costs or
inflation. The MPC will continue to monitor evidence on
labour market slack and indicators of regular pay growth,
which excludes bonuses, closely.
3.1 Labour demand
Having grown robustly in earlier quarters, employment was
broadly flat in the three months to November (Table 3.B).
Robust employment growth over 2012–15 helped to absorb
much of the slack that had built during the financial crisis and
growth was always likely to slow somewhat as that slack
diminished. The recent stalling in employment growth has
occurred alongside a reduction in the proportion of people
participating in the labour market and the unemployment rate
has continued to fall a little, against expectations in the
November Report that it would be flat (Chart 3.1).
Employment growth has been lower than anticipated in
November despite stronger-than-expected output growth
(Section 2). While the weakness in employment growth could
suggest that heightened uncertainty about the outlook has
had a greater effect on hiring than expected, employment
growth can be volatile. The number of vacancies — one key
indicator of hiring — and the number of redundancies have not
pointed to a slowing in employment growth (Chart 3.2).
Employment growth is projected to return to positive but
subdued rates in the near term. That is broadly consistent
with survey indicators of employment intentions, which on 
Section 3 Supply and the labour market 21
average are around pre-crisis levels (Table 3.B). But there are
large differences between those indicators and there continues
to be uncertainty around the extent, timing and composition
of further changes in employment.
In addition to changing the size of their workforce, firms can
also adjust the hours that employees work, such as through
the amount of overtime. Average hours fell in the three
months to November. That could indicate a fall in labour
demand but average hours will also be affected by changes in
people’s desired working patterns (Section 3.2).
3.2 Supply and slack
The amount of slack in the economy — the gap between
demand and potential supply — is an important determinant
of wage growth and broader inflationary pressure. The
potential supply of goods and services cannot, however, be
directly observed.
The MPC considers a range of indicators and approaches to
estimate potential supply and the current degree of slack.
One approach, taking a top-down perspective, is to use
statistical techniques to estimate slack from past observations
of GDP and taking into account other indicators such as
inflation.(1) Given broadly stable output growth over 2016,
this approach suggests that there is currently a small degree of
spare capacity in the economy. The persistent weakness in
wage growth, however, suggests that there is still likely to be
some discernible slack in the labour market (see the box on
pages 18–20). And bottom-up evidence of the components of
supply — discussed further below — also suggest that some
slack has persisted since the financial crisis, particularly within
unemployment. The latest data continue to point to labour
market participation being close to its equilibrium rate,
although there is judged to be a little more slack in average
hours worked. Offsetting that, there is judged to be less spare
capacity within companies than assumed three months ago.
Taking all the evidence together, the MPC’s best collective
judgement is that there is at present a slightly greater degree
of slack than was assumed in the November Report.
Population growth
Population growth is a key driver of increases in the potential
size of the workforce. While population growth therefore
leads to higher supply, it will also lead to increases in demand,
and so is unlikely to have much of a direct impact on slack,
wage growth or inflation. In the MPC’s projections, population
growth is assumed to evolve in line with the ONS’s latest
projection, made in October 2015.

22 Inflation Report February 2017
The main source of uncertainty around population growth
over the next few years relates to the outlook for net
migration. In the four quarters to 2016 Q2, ahead of the
referendum, net inward migration was around 335,000, or
0.5% of the population. Under the ONS projections, net
migration is assumed to fall over the next three years. The
prospects for net migration at present are particularly
uncertain, and will depend on a number of factors, including
the United Kingdom’s relative economic performance, the
behaviour of the sterling exchange rate and government
policy.
Participation in the labour market
The supply of labour also depends on the share of the
population that are in or looking for work. The participation
rate fell in 2016 H2; but overall it has been fairly stable over
the past year (Chart 3.3). Bank staff estimate that
participation is currently close to its equilibrium rate.
The participation rate is projected to remain broadly flat over
the forecast period, reflecting two offsetting factors. As older
people typically have a lower participation rate, the rising
average age of the population will tend to depress the
aggregate participation rate. Offsetting that, however, the
participation rate among older people has been increasing
steadily and is expected to continue to rise.(1)
The projected slowing in income and demand growth
(Section 2) may also affect participation rates over the near
term. On the one hand, a slowing in real income growth as
imported cost pressures pick up could support participation as
households attempt to mitigate the impact on their incomes.
On the other hand, in the face of low labour demand growth,
some individuals could become temporarily discouraged from
looking for work.
Average hours
The outlook for potential supply will depend on how many
hours households would like to work. Although average hours
worked fell towards the end of 2016 (Chart 3.4), they have
been higher over the past year than projected at the time of
the MPC’s previous assessment of aggregate supply-side
conditions in February 2016. As a result, the equilibrium level
of average hours is now judged to be somewhat higher such
that there is currently a degree of slack in average hours. That
equilibrium level is still projected to decline, although more
gradually than previously projected. That decline largely
reflects the fact that older workers generally prefer to work
fewer hours and the average age of the workforce is rising.
One upside risk to this may arise if households seek to
supplement their hours and therefore pay in the face of a
slowing in real income growth (Section 2) to support their
income.

Section 3 Supply and the labour market 23
Unemployment
The unemployment rate fell in the three months to November
to 4.8%. Within that, the long-term unemployment rate has
continued to fall, while shorter-term unemployment rates
have been relatively flat over the past year (Chart 3.5). As
discussed in the box on pages 18–20, the MPC judges that the
equilibrium unemployment rate is likely to be lower than
previously estimated, at 4½%.
Subdued labour demand is expected to lead to a slight rise in
unemployment (Chart 3.1). There is significant uncertainty,
however, around the near-term unemployment projection,
relating both to the strength of labour demand and the
equilibrium rate of unemployment. There are also risks in both
directions to the MPC’s central judgement on the current
equilibrium unemployment rate and a range of views among
MPC members.
In addition, the equilibrium rate may continue to change over
time. Some of the factors that appear to have contributed to
a fall over the recent past, such as increases in educational
attainment and lower flows from employment to
unemployment, may continue to bear down on the
equilibrium rate. The rise in wage rates associated with the
National Living Wage could, however, weigh on labour
demand in some sectors and therefore lead to a small rise in
the equilibrium unemployment rate.
Productivity
As well as the total number of hours that can be worked,
potential supply also depends on how productively those
hours can be put to use. Four-quarter hourly productivity
growth is expected to have picked up sharply to 2.2% in
2016 Q4 (Chart 3.6), much stronger than anticipated in
November. In part, that reflected the fall in average hours
worked (Chart 3.4). Consistent with a broadly stable path for
average hours worked, hourly productivity growth is projected
to fall back in coming quarters (Table 3.C). Growth in output
per worker — which matters more for average wage growth
— picked up by less, but is also projected to slow over the near
term.
Productivity growth has tended to be well below expectations
in recent years, contributing to a succession of errors in the
MPC’s forecasts for wage growth (see the box on
pages 18–20). The persistent weakness in productivity growth
is likely to reflect a range of factors. For instance, the stock of
capital — equipment that can be put to use — has grown more
gradually than labour supply over recent years. As additional
capital tends to boost productivity, that will have weighed on
growth.
More generally, productivity growth has been sluggish across a
number of advanced economies. That may have reflected the
effects of the financial crisis and there is evidence that the

divergence between the most productive firms and the rest
has increased globally.(1)
Future UK productivity growth will be sensitive to the
post-Brexit trading arrangements between the United
Kingdom and its economic partners. The box on page 29 of
the August Report set out some of the long-term effects of
openness to trade on productivity growth. It remains difficult
to know the nature, scale and speed of companies’ adjustment
in anticipation of changes in future trading arrangements and
given the uncertainty around those arrangements. Those
uncertainties, as well as uncertainty over the outlook for
domestic demand, are likely to lead to lower investment in
capital equipment, research and skills than would otherwise be
the case (Section 2) and so could weigh on productivity
growth.
Overall, underlying potential productivity is projected to grow
at a little over 1% a year, broadly in line with the November
projection (Section 5). Productivity had been thought to be
below its potential level in November, implying that actual
productivity could grow a little more quickly for a period as
companies worked off some slack. Following the reassessment
of spare capacity across the economy in this Report, there is
now judged to be greater slack within the labour market but
less within companies. Reflecting that judgement,
productivity is now expected to grow broadly in line with
potential and therefore more slowly than in the November
Report.

4 Costs and prices
CPI inflation picked up to 1.6% in December. It is projected to rise above the 2% target for a time
as the past fall in the sterling exchange rate passes through to consumer prices. The extent to
which inflation rises above the target will be sensitive to any further movements in sterling, which
has been volatile. It will also depend on domestic cost pressures. Slowing domestic demand
growth is likely to weigh slightly on labour cost pressures and domestically generated inflation.
Inflation expectations have risen but are judged to be broadly consistent with the MPC’s 2% target.
4.1 Consumer price developments and the
near-term outlook
CPI inflation increased to 1.6% in December, from 1% in
September and above the projection of 1.4% at the time
of the November Report (Chart 4.1).(1) The upside news partly
reflected stronger-than-expected goods price inflation. A
pickup in the contribution of airfares, a component of services
prices, also pushed up inflation by more than anticipated, but
this component tends to be volatile.
Inflation has picked up as the effects of the appreciation in
sterling during 2013–15 have diminished, the effects of the
more recent depreciation in sterling have started to emerge,
and as oil prices have increased. That is apparent in a positive
contribution from fuel prices (Chart 4.2). The drag from food
prices has also lessened, albeit by a bit less than had been
expected in November (see the box on page 26). And the
drag on inflation from other imported goods and services
prices has diminished.
CPI inflation is projected to continue to rise to around the
2% target in Q1 (Chart 4.1), and then above it further ahead,
as the effects of the fall in sterling over 2016 on import prices
continue to pass through to consumer prices (Section 4.2).
The further rise in the US dollar price of oil since November
will also increase the contribution of fuel prices to inflation.
The evolution of these external cost pressures will be sensitive
to further movements in sterling (Section 5), which has been
volatile (Section 1).
The outlook for inflation will also depend on how domestic
cost pressures develop and how companies adjust their
margins (Section 4.3). Slowing domestic demand growth
(1) CPI inflation was 0.9% in October, more than 1 percentage point away from the
MPC’s 2% target. This triggered an open letter from the Governor to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, as required by the monetary policy remit. The letter is available on the
Bank’s website at www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Documents/pdf/

(Section 2) is likely to weigh somewhat on
labour cost growth and companies’ margins. A period
of above-target inflation could, however, present a risk to
domestic cost pressures if it were to lead to markedly
higher inflation expectations that, in turn, influence
wage and price-setting decisions (see the box on
pages 30–31).
4.2 Imported cost pressures
CPI inflation is affected by developments in external cost
pressures, such as the cost of energy and imported goods and
services. These in turn are sensitive to changes in the sterling
exchange rate (Section 1). Following the fall in sterling over
2016, import prices have increased significantly, reflecting a
rise in both energy and non-energy costs. Survey-based
Developments in food price inflation
Food prices are sensitive to external developments and tend to
respond quickly to changes in the exchange rate. They can be
an important driver of wider inflation, directly accounting for
10% of the CPI basket. Moreover, the 2016 Q1 Bank/TNS
household survey found that changes in the prices of food and
drink were the most important influence on households’
perceptions of overall inflation.
The high sensitivity of retail food prices to changes in imported
food prices partly reflects the fact that around 50% of food
and drink consumed in the United Kingdom is imported. In
addition, food is highly tradable, particularly within the
European Union. The pass-through of changes in sterling to
food prices is often quicker than for other imported goods,
with prices adjusting more frequently, particularly on more
perishable items.
During 2016, retail food prices have not increased in line
with the rise in sterling food import prices (Chart A). While
that deviation could signal a lessening in the extent or speed
at which changes in external cost pressures are feeding
through to consumer prices, food prices will also be affected
by domestic pressures.
One factor that could affect the pass-through of higher import
prices is changes in the composition of food items, such as
quality or size, although the ONS makes adjustments for this
when constructing the CPI. A chocolate producer, for instance,
may reduce the size of a chocolate bar in response to an
increase in external costs, rather than increase its price. In this
case, the ONS will adjust the observed price for any changes in
weight. The ONS will also attempt to capture any material
changes in quality, although more subtle shifts can be difficult
to identify. Overall, non-price changes are unlikely to account
for much of the recent deviation between retail and import
prices.
The most likely reason for subdued food price inflation over
the past year appears to be competition in the supermarket
industry, as reported by contacts of the Bank’s Agents.
Customers have also reportedly become more price-sensitive
in recent years, partly as a result of greater price transparency
via the internet. In this environment, food retailers and
producers may have absorbed the recent rises in external costs
in their margins to a greater degree than normal to retain
market share. Nonetheless, given the scale of the fall in
sterling, it is unlikely that retailers and producers will be able
to continue absorbing higher costs in their margins
indefinitely. Already for some seasonal food items, where
contracts with suppliers tend to be renewed more frequently,
prices have begun to pick up. As such, it is likely that retail
food prices more generally will start to respond to pressure
from higher sterling import prices over 2017.

indicators have for some months suggested that rising import
prices are pushing up companies’ input prices (Chart 4.3).
Energy prices
The sterling oil spot price has risen by 9% since the November
Report (Chart 4.4). The futures curve, on which the MPC’s
forecasts are conditioned, remains broadly unchanged,
however. According to market contacts, the rise in spot prices
partly reflected the agreement in November between OPEC
and some non-OPEC oil producers, committing to reduce
production from the start of 2017 by around 2%. In addition,
it is likely to reflect the stronger outlook for global demand
growth (Section 1).
The rise in sterling oil prices since the start of 2016 has begun
to push up inflation (Chart 4.2), with retail petrol prices in
December around 10% higher than a year ago. The cost of oil
currently makes up around a quarter of the cost of petrol and
changes in oil prices tend to be passed through quickly. As
such, the contribution of fuel prices to inflation is projected to
increase slightly further, peaking in 2017 H1.
Changes in wholesale gas and electricity prices affect CPI
inflation through households’ and businesses’ utility bills.
Wholesale gas spot and futures prices have increased by 4%
on average since November (Chart 4.4). One major supplier
has announced a rise in domestic electricity prices from March,
in addition to a smaller cut in domestic gas prices from
January, while a number of other suppliers have committed to
freezing their tariffs only until spring. Overall, retail energy
bills are projected to increase in the first half of 2017, slightly
earlier than anticipated in November.
Non-energy import prices
Other commodity prices have increased since November
alongside the pickup in energy prices (Chart 4.5). This,
combined with the fall in sterling over the past year, is likely to
feed through into higher non-energy UK import prices.
Non-energy foreign export prices, weighted according to
countries’ shares in UK imports, are expected to have fallen
slightly in the four quarters to 2016 Q4 (Chart 4.6), though
they are projected to rise over this year. The fall in sterling
has, however, also already begun to put significant upward
pressure on the cost of UK imports, which account
for around 30% of the CPI basket. Four-quarter sterling
non-energy import price inflation increased to 6% in 2016 Q3.
As discussed in previous Reports, Bank staff estimate that, on
average, 60% of any change in sterling-denominated foreign
export prices is passed through to UK import prices, with that
pass-through mostly completed within a year. Based on this,
the 18% fall in sterling from its November 2015 peak by itself
would be consistent with an increase of around 10% in import
prices once passed through completely. Consistent with that
average pass-through over the past, import price inflation is
expected to have risen further in 2016 Q4 (Chart 4.6).

28 Inflation Report February 2017
However, both the extent and pace of pass-through to import
prices are uncertain and are likely to vary over time.
Import price pass-through to consumer prices
The pass-through of changes in import prices to CPI inflation
depends on a number of factors. These include the import
content of consumption, the share of domestically produced
goods that are substitutes for imports and how economic
conditions affect businesses’ pricing decisions. As discussed in
previous Reports, Bank staff estimate that, on average over the
past, changes in import prices have typically passed through to
CPI in line with the import share. Pass-through is estimated to
take place gradually, with annual inflation still being affected
four years after the change in sterling.
How much and how quickly businesses pass through changes
in import prices associated with a change in sterling, and
whether the prices of other goods and services adjust, is
uncertain and will vary over time. It is still too early for
changes in import prices over the second half of 2016 to be
materially affecting most consumer prices. Some components
respond more rapidly to changes in imported costs, however,
and may provide some signal on the pace of pass-through. As
noted above, petrol prices have already responded to changes
in sterling oil prices.
Another component of CPI where the increase in import prices
might be expected to be already visible at this stage is food.
As explained in the box on page 26, changes in import prices
typically pass through to the cost of food relatively quickly.
Retail food prices have begun to pick up, having fallen for
much of the past two years, but annual growth in December
remained negative. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents have
suggested that competitive pressures specific to the food retail
sector may be holding down food price inflation.
As discussed in the November Report, the MPC judges that the
speed of pass-through from import prices to consumer prices
of the depreciation in sterling since its peak in November 2015
is likely to be faster than average (Section 5). This reflects
evidence that suggests that large moves in the exchange
rate,(1) or moves in exchange rates that stem from supply
developments,(2) tend to be associated with faster
pass-through to consumer prices. These conditions
remain relevant. Sterling is 18% below its November 2015
peak and appears to have been sensitive to changing views
on the likely nature of UK trading arrangements following
Brexit (Section 1). The MPC will continue to monitor closely
how pass-through is evolving.

Section 4 Costs and prices 29
4.3 Domestic cost pressures
In addition to imported cost pressures, changes in domestic
costs are a key driver of CPI inflation and will determine where
inflation settles once changes in imported costs have passed
through. The path for inflation, however, will also depend on
the extent to which companies adjust their margins in
response to developments in those costs. There are a number
of indicators of the rate at which domestic costs and profit
margins are changing, known as domestically generated
inflation (DGI). Overall, these indicators have increased in
2016 Q3, but are still below past average rates (Chart 4.7).
One important measure of DGI is growth in labour costs,
which form the largest part of the domestic cost of producing
output. As explained in the box on pages 18–19, subdued
growth in unit labour costs — the average labour cost of
producing a unit of output — in recent years has largely
reflected the weakness in wage growth (Chart 4.8).
Four-quarter whole-economy unit labour cost growth has
however picked up in recent quarters and, at 2.3% in Q3, was
only a little below pre-crisis averages. That recent pickup
mainly reflects a rise in non-wage labour costs, which include
National Insurance and pensions contributions.
Unit labour cost growth is projected to fall back a little during
2017. Growth in both wages and productivity per worker are
expected to increase slightly over coming quarters (Section 3),
while the contribution from non-wage costs, which tend to be
volatile, is expected to decline. The continued phasing in of
automatic enrolment in workplace pensions schemes is likely
to push up non-wage labour costs over 2017, but overall those
costs are projected to be broadly unchanged. Consistent with
this, respondents to the Agents’ pay survey in January reported
on balance that changes to employers’ pension contributions
were only expected to be a minor factor in pushing up labour
costs over the next twelve months.
Developments in companies’ margins will determine the
extent to which these changes in domestic costs, alongside
changes in external costs, affect consumer prices. Margins on
consumer goods and services were estimated to be squeezed
during the financial crisis, but recovered during 2014 and 2015
(Chart 4.9). In recent quarters, however, margins appear to
have narrowed, and are currently perhaps slightly below past
averages. This is consistent with the limited change in
consumer prices so far, as import costs have risen.
Firms are likely to seek to rebuild their margins over time
by raising prices. As explained in Section 4.2, the nature of the
fall in sterling is likely to mean they do so somewhat more
quickly than on average over the past. The outlook for
inflation may also be affected by changes in inflation
expectations, insofar as they influence wage and price-setting
behaviour (see the box on pages 30–31).

30 Inflation Report February 2017
Monitoring inflation expectations
The MPC projects that inflation will rise sharply above the 2%
target, and only fall back gradually, as higher import prices
pass through (Section 5). As noted in the Monetary Policy
Summary, however, there are limits to the extent to which the
MPC is willing to tolerate above-target inflation. Those limits
depend in part on the evolution of inflation expectations.
Material shifts in people’s beliefs in the MPC’s willingness and
ability to return inflation to target, were they to feed through
into prices and wages, could increase the risk that inflation
remains more persistently above the target.
This box sets out the range of indicators the MPC monitors to
judge whether inflation expectations remain consistent with
inflation returning to the 2% target.
Overall, the MPC judges that indicators of medium-term
inflation expectations continue to be broadly consistent with
the 2% target and remain well anchored. The levels of
medium to long-term measures of inflation expectations have
picked up, but are broadly around past averages (Table 1).
While longer-term expectations appear to have become more
sensitive to changes in shorter-term expectations, that
sensitivity may well return to normal as inflation rises. There
is also little evidence that financial markets’ and professional
forecasters’ uncertainty about inflation in the medium term
has risen recently. The MPC will continue to monitor
measures of expectations closely as inflation rises further.
Levels of inflation expectations
Overall, indicators of inflation expectations increased over the
second half of 2016, and are around their levels in 2006–07,
when inflation had been close to the 2% target for some time
(Chart A).(1) Judging whether inflation expectations are
consistent with the MPC’s target depends in part on the
horizon under consideration.
Indicators of short-term inflation expectations tend to respond
to changes in actual inflation and the near-term outlook.(2)
Consistent with this, survey measures of short-term household
and corporate inflation expectations, and measures of
short-term expectations derived from financial markets, fell
somewhat below series lows during the recent period of low
CPI inflation (Table 1).(3) More recently, these measures have
risen as CPI inflation and the MPC’s own projections have
picked up.
Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are potentially
more informative when judging whether expectations are
consistent with inflation at target in the medium term. Survey
measures of long-term household expectations fell below past
averages when inflation was low, but by much less than
short-term measures (Table 1). These have drifted slightly
higher over 2016 to around past averages.
Having fallen earlier in the year, indicators of longer-term
inflation expectations derived from financial market prices for
inflation compensation rose ahead of the November Report to
around past averages. Since then, they have been broadly
stable, in contrast to rises in equivalent measures for the
United States and euro area (Chart 1.7). Market-specific
factors in the United Kingdom can sometimes make
(1) The level of inflation expectations is assessed against series averages, as measures of
long-term inflation expectations do not directly reference CPI inflation. For more
information, see Domit, S, Jackson, C and Roberts-Sklar, M (2015), ‘Do inflation
expectations currently pose a risk to inflation?’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin,

(3) Household measures exclude the GfK/EC balance of expected price trends (as in
Chart 2.5). That survey asks whether inflation is expected to rise or fall over the next
twelve months, by comparison with the past twelve months. As such, results cannot
readily be interpreted as consistent with a particular level of expected inflation.

developments in these measures difficult to interpret. For
example, market contacts have suggested that some of the fall
and then rise during 2016 has, in part, reflected changes in
demand for inflation protection from pension funds.
Sensitivity of inflation expectations
If longer-term measures move with news about the near-term
outlook, this could suggest that expectations are not well
anchored. Financial market measures do appear to have
become more sensitive to short-term inflation news over the
past two years. During 2004–07, and in the period of high
inflation during 2010–11, there was little correlation between
inflation expectations beyond two years ahead with those one
year ahead (Chart B). Since 2015, however, longer-term
inflation expectations have, on average, tended
to move by around 0.3 percentage points in response to a
1 percentage point change in one year ahead expectations.
While that increased sensitivity could suggest a risk that
inflation expectations are less well anchored than in the past,
it is also possible that the pickup in sensitivity reflected
specific concerns that the period of low inflation during
2015–16 could have become more entrenched. As such, this
sensitivity may return to more normal levels as inflation
continues to rise and those concerns recede.
Uncertainty around future inflation
Indicators of uncertainty about future inflation may contain
information about people’s degree of confidence in the MPC
achieving the inflation target. Uncertainty about future
inflation among professional forecasters — calculated as the
average probability attached to CPI inflation being greater
than 1 percentage point above or below the target in the
medium term — has been broadly stable in recent years, albeit
higher than prior to the crisis (Chart C). Market-based
indicators of uncertainty about future inflation, implied by
options prices, have also been relatively stable and lower than
during the crisis.

32 Inflation Report February 2017
5 Prospects for inflation
UK economic activity remained resilient in the second half of 2016. Growth is likely to slow over
2017 as households adjust their spending to lower real income growth resulting in large part from
the 18% fall in sterling since late 2015. That fall in sterling will raise CPI inflation, which is likely to
return to around the 2% target by February and then rise above it over the following months.
Conditioned on a market path for Bank Rate that rises to just under 0.75% by early 2020, the MPC
projects CPI inflation to fall back gradually from the middle of 2018. Continued pass-through of
higher import prices means, however, that inflation is projected to remain somewhat above the
2% target at the end of the Committee’s three-year forecast period.
The UK economy has remained resilient, with activity growing
at close to its past average rate in 2016. Growth has been
stronger than envisaged in the immediate aftermath of the vote
to leave the European Union when survey evidence pointed to a
sharp slowdown in activity. That partly reflects robust growth
in consumer spending, with few signs that households are
cutting back expenditure ahead of a squeeze in their real
incomes. Official data for investment have been considerably
weaker, although above recent expectations. Reinforcing
the domestic news, there are signs of increasing momentum
in the global economy with a stronger medium-term outlook
in several economies, supported by fiscal policy
(Key Judgement 1). That has been reflected in global asset
prices, with longer-term interest rates and equity prices rising.
Domestic demand growth is still expected to slow over the
course of this year as higher prices for imported goods and
services begin to weigh on households’ spending power
(Key Judgement 2). That pulls down four-quarter GDP growth,
which settles at around 1¾% from the end of 2017 (Chart 5.1).
That slowdown comes a little later than previously assumed.
Moreover, the Government’s Autumn Statement represented a
fiscal stimulus, relative to previously announced plans, the
outlook for global growth is stronger, and credit conditions and
equity prices are more supportive. Taking all the news together,
the MPC now judges that the growth outlook is stronger than
thought in November (Table 5.A). Overall, in the central
projection that leaves the level of GDP around 1% higher in
three years’ time than projected in November. Relative to
expectations in the May 2016 Report, just before the
EU referendum, however, the level of GDP is still around 1½%
lower in the medium term despite the significant monetary,
macroprudential and fiscal support since then.
The stronger demand profile is in large part matched by a higher
level of supply. That reflects a judgement as part of the MPC’s

Chart 5.1 GDP projection based on market interest rate

The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b). To the left of the vertical dashed line,
the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past; to the right, it
reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future. If economic circumstances
identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that
the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of
those occasions. The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within
each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast
period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of
100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere
outside the green area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the
light grey background. See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a
fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.
Section 5 Prospects for inflation 33
regular assessment of aggregate supply-side conditions. In
light of repeated downside surprises for wage growth in recent
years, the best collective judgement of the Committee is that
the sustainable rate of unemployment is lower than previously
thought at 4½% (Key Judgement 3). The central judgement,
around which there remains considerable uncertainty and a
range of views among Committee members, implies a higher
level of potential supply and hence a wider margin of slack in
the economy at the start of the forecast period. That greater
slack weighs on projected wage growth.
The outlook for supply also depends on the United Kingdom’s
post-Brexit trading arrangements and their impact on
companies’ operations. The projections in this Report continue
to be conditioned on the average of a range of possible
eventual outcomes for those arrangements. Given those
different possible outcomes, uncertainty is assumed to remain
elevated, albeit a little lower than in the November Report,
weighing on investment though less so on consumption.
Productivity grows at below historical average rates
(Key Judgement 3). Taking demand and supply together,
relative to the November projection, there is judged to be a
little more slack in the economy at the start of the forecast
period, but a little less by the end. The MPC judges that the
balance of risks to the outlook for both GDP and potential
supply growth lie to the downside in the second and third
years of the forecast period.
CPI inflation has risen markedly over the past year and is
judged likely to return to around the 2% target by February.
Much of the rise to date reflects the elimination of past
drags from food, energy and import prices, together with
renewed rises in oil prices. The projected path for inflation
over the next three years in large part reflects the impact
of higher import prices following sterling’s depreciation
(Key Judgement 4). In the run-up to the February Report, the
sterling exchange rate was 3% higher than three months

earlier, but still 18% below its late-2015 peak. Higher import
prices are judged likely to have their greatest effect on
CPI inflation in around a year’s time, but still to be pushing
inflation above the 2% target at the end of the forecast period,
fully accounting for the overshoot (Chart 5.2). Following
sterling’s recent appreciation, the CPI projection is slightly
lower than three months ago further out (Chart 5.3). The risks
around the inflation projection are balanced, with substantial
risks on both sides around the outlook for wage growth and
hence domestic inflationary pressures (Key Judgement 3).
The expectations for the economy, set out above and
summarised in Table 5.A, are conditioned on asset prices in the
fifteen days to 25 January. These imply a path for Bank Rate
that rises to just under ¾% by early 2020, around 30 basis
points higher than the November Report path (Table 5.B).(1) In
recent months, longer-term market interest rates — such as
those on UK government debt — have risen further, alongside
similar moves in other advanced economies. Estimated spreads
over reference rates for household borrowing fell and non-price
terms for consumer credit also improved (Section 1). The
FTSE All-Share index rose by 3% on the quarter.
At its meeting ending on 1 February 2017, the MPC voted to
maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%, to continue with the programme
of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond
purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves,
totalling up to £10 billion and to maintain the stock of
UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of
central bank reserves, at £435 billion. The factors behind that
decision are set out in the Monetary Policy Summary on
pages i–ii of this Report, and in more detail in the Minutes of
the meeting.(2) The remainder of this section sets out the
MPC’s projections, and the risks around them, in more detail.
5.1 The MPC’s key judgements and risks
Key Judgement 1: UK trade will be supported by the past
depreciation of the sterling exchange rate and the expected
pickup in global growth
The latest activity indicators suggest more momentum in the
advanced economies around the turn of the year than expected
three months ago. Indicators of inflation have risen, in part
reflecting increases in oil and other commodity prices, as well
as some strengthening in core inflation. Moreover, it now

Bank Rate following a path implied by market yields; the Term Funding Scheme (TFS)
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves; the stock of purchased gilts financed
by the issuance of central bank reserves remaining at £435 billion throughout the
forecast period; the stock of purchased corporate bonds financed by the issuance of
central bank reserves reaching £10 billion and remaining there throughout the forecast
period; the Recommendations of the Financial Policy Committee and the current
regulatory plans of the Prudential Regulation Authority; the Government’s tax and
spending plans as set out in the November 2016 Autumn Statement; commodity
prices following market paths; and the sterling exchange rate remaining broadly flat.

seems likely that the support from fiscal policy over the
forecast period will be greater in a number of economies. That
stronger outlook has been reflected in notable rises in global
interest rates and equity prices. The MPC’s projections
incorporate a pickup in global growth in 2017, although it
remains below average rates throughout the forecast period
(Chart 5.4) and the risks to the outlook remain skewed to the
downside.
In the United States, four-quarter growth has strengthened
broadly as expected in November, supported by robust retail
spending growth. A range of indicators including sharp rises in
business and consumer confidence point to strengthening
underlying demand. In addition, the fiscal plans of the new
administration are likely to provide more support than
incorporated in the November projections. Acting in the
other direction, market prices suggest a path for interest rates
that rises by ¾ percentage point more than the path three
months ago and the US dollar has appreciated by 4%. Overall,
US growth is projected to pick up to around 2¼% this year
and next before slowing a little in 2019 (Table 5.C). There is
considerable uncertainty about the US outlook as the details
of any fiscal package and other economic policies are yet to be
announced.
Activity and consumer spending data in the euro area have
also shown signs of further improvement. GDP Growth is
projected to average 1¾% throughout the forecast period
(Table 5.C), with continued support from monetary policy
and a slightly looser fiscal stance than in November. That is
associated with a further fall in unemployment and inflation
at only 1.6% in 2019.
The outlook for emerging market economies (EMEs) remains
subdued. Taken together, growth in EMEs is likely to pick up a
little as Russia and Brazil come out of recession. In China, data
have remained robust but financial conditions have tightened
and net capital outflows have increased again (Section 1).
Growth in China is projected to slow slightly to around 6%
over the forecast period, the same outlook as three months
ago. The risks around that remain to the downside given the
rapid expansion of domestic credit that has accompanied
recent growth and the recent acceleration in net capital
outflows.
The global outlook is a little more supportive for UK exports,
and hence net trade, than three months ago. The recent rise in
the sterling exchange rate, if it persists, will provide some
offset. As in November, companies here and abroad are
projected to begin to adjust some of their activities in light of
Brexit, weighing on gross trade flows. The depreciation of
sterling relative to late 2015 provides some support to
exporters, however, and reduces demand for imports, so that
net trade boosts growth for much of the forecast period.

shrink to around 3% of GDP by the end of the forecast period.
Uncertainties around these paths stem from the possibility of
further moves in the exchange rate and news about trading
arrangements.
Key Judgement 2: weak real income growth weighs on
UK domestic demand
Domestic demand growth has been stronger than anticipated
in the summer, when heightened uncertainty and the prospect
of weaker income growth were judged likely to weigh on
spending growth quite quickly. This expectation was informed
by evidence from surveys at the time, which pointed to a
contraction in overall activity. Quarterly household
consumption growth was resilient over 2016, with little sign
yet of any drags from uncertainty or a prospective weakening
in real income. Nevertheless, a number of factors are
projected to weigh on real income growth over the forecast
period, including higher prices for imported goods and
services, the prospect of only modest productivity growth and
the fiscal consolidation, albeit to a slightly lesser degree than
under previous fiscal plans (Section 2). Household real income
is projected to be broadly flat over 2017 (Table 5.E), and
four-quarter consumer spending growth is judged likely to
slow in response, albeit a little more gradually than assumed
in November (Table 5.D). Income and consumption growth
pick up modestly in the second half of the forecast period, but
to well below pre-crisis average rates.
There remains uncertainty about the extent and timing of the
slowdown in consumption growth. The MPC’s projections
incorporate a significant fall in the saving ratio over the next
three years (Chart 5.5) as consumers take time to adjust
spending growth to weaker income flows. There are two-sided
risks around that profile. The saving ratio could fall more
sharply, in the near term at least, supporting growth.
Consumer credit has been expanding at a robust pace in recent
quarters, and it is possible that households will take advantage
of relatively low borrowing costs to maintain a higher rate of
consumption growth even as income growth stalls. If,
however, households react more sharply to uncertainty or the
prospect of weaker income growth, they may be unwilling to
reduce their saving rates to the extent projected.
The housing market also surprised to the upside over the
second half of 2016 (Section 2). Over the forecast period,
weak real income growth and elevated uncertainty weigh on
housing market activity so that real housing investment
growth slows, and annual house price inflation drops back to
just over 3½%.
Resilient household spending over 2016 contrasts with a fall in
business investment. Business investment was estimated to
be 2% lower than a year earlier in 2016 Q3 and surveys
suggest that it will remain subdued, especially in the service

sector. It is likely that heightened uncertainty around the
impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the
European Union is weighing on planned investment spending.
Companies may also be scaling back some projects in light of
higher prices for imported investment goods and the
prospective slowdown in consumer demand. Business
investment is projected to fall further over the first half of
2017 before growing modestly further out (Table 5.D). That is
associated with very weak growth in the capital stock, relative
to the past and expectations immediately prior to the
EU referendum. The impact of Brexit remains the key risk to
the outlook for investment, including companies’ decisions on
location, and expansion plans in the United Kingdom in light of
new trading arrangements.
Overall, private domestic demand growth slows over 2017, led
by a marked weakening in consumption growth, before
recovering gradually further out. Private domestic demand

38 Inflation Report February 2017
growth is stronger than in November in the first half of the
forecast period. Total domestic demand is further boosted
by the higher government spending plans set out in the
Autumn Statement.
Key Judgement 3: slack in the labour market and weak
productivity growth weigh on wage growth
After averaging over 4% prior to the crisis, wage growth has
remained modest in 2015–16 at around 2%–3%. It has
consistently been some way below the MPC’s past projections
(see the box on pages 18–20). As set out in previous Reports,
weak wage growth in part reflects weak productivity growth.
And over the past couple of years it is likely that low inflation
has also played a role in limiting pay settlements.
Notwithstanding these effects, the MPC had expected the fall
in unemployment back to around its pre-crisis rate (Chart 5.6)
to lead to a greater pickup in wage growth.
In its regular assessment of aggregate supply-side conditions,
the MPC considered the continued weakness in wage growth
alongside a broad range of other evidence on the labour
market. As a result, it has lowered its view of the equilibrium
unemployment rate from around 5% to 4½%. As well as
helping to explain the recent weakness in wage growth, a
lower equilibrium unemployment rate is also consistent with
the rising average age of the workforce and increased degree
of educational attainment, which are both characteristics that
have tended to be associated with lower unemployment rates.
Tax and benefit reforms over many years may also have
lowered the equilibrium rate by increasing the incentive and
ability to move from unemployment to employment.
Moreover, as the labour market recovery has continued,
long-term unemployment has continued to fall steadily,
suggesting fewer constraints to these people returning to
work. The MPC’s updated estimate of 4½% is consistent with
technical analysis of labour market data, and a range of
models for wage growth, which point to estimates for the
sustainable unemployment rate between 4% and 4¾%. The
downward revision to the equilibrium rate lowers wage growth
by just over 0.3 percentage points a year on average, and
inflation by 0.2 percentage points in the second and third
years of the forecast, other things equal. There is, however,
significant uncertainty around the estimate of the equilibrium
unemployment rate, which is unobservable, and there is a
range of views among MPC members.
Since November, Bank staff have also assessed their estimates
of broader measures of slack (Section 3). The latest data
continue to point to labour market participation being close to
its equilibrium rate. The estimated equilibrium level of
average hours worked has been revised up somewhat. That
means that the current rate of average hours worked is a
touch below equilibrium — pointing to a degree of additional
labour market slack — rather than a little above it as was the
case in November. Offsetting the impact of that on overall

The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b). The coloured bands have the same
interpretation as in Chart 5.2, and portray 90% of the probability distribution. The calibration of
this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example,
it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on
unemployment in successive quarters. The fan begins in 2016 Q4, a quarter earlier than the fan
for CPI inflation. That is because Q4 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in
part on data for October and November. The unemployment rate was 4.8% in the three months
to November, and is projected to be 4.8% in Q4 as a whole. A significant proportion of this
distribution lies below Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment
rate. There is therefore uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart.
Section 5 Prospects for inflation 39
slack, there is judged to be less spare capacity within
companies than assumed three months ago. That has
implications for the productivity projection. In November,
companies were judged to be operating with substantial spare
capacity, which was worked off over the forecast period so
productivity grew faster than its potential rate. The latest
assessment suggests that companies are now operating with
little spare capacity, so productivity grows in line with its
potential over most of the forecast period.
The MPC’s forecasts continue to assume subdued potential
productivity growth over the forecast period, at a little over
1% a year. That partly reflects weak investment. In addition,
expectations of a less open set of trading arrangements, for a
period at least, are projected to weigh on potential
productivity growth, given, for example, the gradual
reorientation of business models that they will necessitate.
Despite that weak underlying picture, the latest data suggest
that measured hourly productivity growth rose sharply at the
end of 2016, as hours worked fell against a continued
expansion in output. That strength is assumed to be
temporary (Section 3) and productivity growth is projected to
drop back to its potential rate over the forecast period
(Chart 5.7). The MPC judges that the balance of risks to the
outlook for supply lie to the downside and that is reflected in
the balance of risks around demand and hence the GDP profile
as well.
Taken together, some degree of remaining slack in the
economy and only modest productivity growth keep wage
growth relatively subdued. The drag from slack eases slightly
over the forecast period. The drag from past low inflation
(Key Judgement 4) also dissipates over time. Overall, wage
growth rises gradually to just under 3½% by early 2020,
below its pre-crisis average rate and the November projection.
Adjusting wages for the low rate of productivity growth, unit
labour cost growth rises to rates consistent with inflation
around the 2% target in the medium term (Table 5.C).
There is considerable uncertainty about the outlook for wage
growth. The pace of demand growth will influence wage
demands. On the supply side, a higher equilibrium
unemployment rate than assumed would imply more upward
pressure on companies’ costs and prices from the central path
for demand, or a lower one less pressure. Uncertainty also
stems from the impact of the rise in headline inflation,
especially if that leads inflation expectations to rise above
historical averages (Key Judgement 4). It is also possible that
higher bonus payments could raise aggregate wage growth
temporarily following recent strength in profits, although this
would have limited implications for companies’ costs or
inflation. The MPC will continue to monitor evidence on
labour market slack and indicators of regular pay growth,
which excludes bonuses, closely.

40 Inflation Report February 2017
Key Judgement 4: higher import prices take inflation above
the 2% target for a period
CPI inflation has risen markedly from close to zero in 2015 and
is projected to be back around the 2% target by February,
broadly as expected in November. The rise so far largely
reflects external factors: the unwinding of drags from past
falls in the prices of energy, food and other imported items,
and some pass-through of recent rises in energy and food
prices. A further rise in inflation above the target is expected
as the 18% fall in sterling since November 2015 feeds through
to higher retail prices.
The MPC assumes that the depreciation will push up import
prices by around 10% in total. The impact of the fall in the
pound is already apparent in indicators of import prices
(Chart 5.8). Past experience suggests that retail prices will
fully reflect these higher import costs over time, in line with
the share of imports in consumption. As in November, the
MPC judges that the size and source of the fall in sterling
means that companies are likely to raise prices a little more
quickly than they have done on average in response to past
exchange rate moves. Despite that, higher import prices are
still projected to be pushing inflation above the 2% target at
the end of the forecast period. The contribution of import
prices to CPI inflation rises to around 1 percentage point this
year, before falling to around ½ percentage point by the end
of the forecast period, and back towards zero a year or so later.
There remains uncertainty about how much and how quickly
the depreciation in sterling will feed through into CPI inflation.
There is also uncertainty about the broader impact of the rise
in inflation. It is possible that a period of above-target
inflation will have a greater effect on inflation expectations
and wage growth than in the central projection
(Key Judgement 3). To date, as inflation has picked up,
shorter-term measures of inflation expectations have risen
broadly in line with the MPC’s own expectations. Having risen
to around historical averages ahead of the November Report,
financial market indicators of inflation expectations at longer
horizons have been broadly stable, in contrast to rises in the
United States and euro area (Section 1). The MPC continues to
judge that inflation expectations remain well anchored but will
monitor them closely as inflation rises above the 2% target.

5.2 The projections for demand,
unemployment and inflation
Based on these judgements and the risks around them, and
under the path for Bank Rate based on market yields and the
MPC’s policy package, four-quarter GDP growth is projected
to slow over 2017 and remain below average rates further out,
although it is slightly above its potential rate in the third year
of the forecast period. The slowing in growth reflects
weakening consumption growth as households adapt to a
period of very low real income growth.

footnote (b).
(b) The anticipated revisions to recent estimates of quarterly GDP growth do not have implications for

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 41
The GDP projection is higher than that in the November Report
(Table 5.F). That reflects the fiscal stimulus announced in the
Chancellor’s Autumn Statement, firmer momentum in global
activity, higher global equity prices and more supportive
UK credit conditions particularly for households. So far there
have been relatively few signs of the slowdown in consumer
spending that the Committee had anticipated following the
EU referendum and the MPC now judges that households will
take a little longer to adjust their spending. Overall, that leaves
the level of GDP around 1% higher in three years’ time than
projected in November. As in November, the uncertainty
around the central projection is judged to be greater than usual
but the risks around the projection are skewed to the downside
(Chart 5.9), reflecting the possibility that supply growth is more
subdued than in the central projection in years two and three,
which would weigh on demand.
That stronger central projection for demand has not led to
significantly stronger inflationary pressure in these projections,
reflecting the higher level of sterling and the MPC’s regular
assessment of aggregate supply-side conditions. That
assessment has resulted in an upward revision to potential
supply. In particular, a broad range of evidence points to the
equilibrium unemployment rate being around ½ percentage
point lower than previously assumed, at 4½%. In the latest
projections, stronger demand growth means that the
unemployment rate rises to only 5% (Chart 5.6), significantly
lower than assumed in November, but the degree of economic
slack is only a little smaller in the latest projections.
The main influence on the profile of CPI inflation over the
forecast period remains the sterling exchange rate. Higher
import prices are assumed to push inflation above the
2% target throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.10), though
their contribution begins to fall back in 2018. That contribution,
and hence the CPI inflation projection, is a little lower than
three months ago (Chart 5.11) reflecting the 3% appreciation in
sterling. There are substantial risks around the outlook for wage
growth, and hence inflation, stemming from the assumptions
about both demand and supply. A sharper pickup in wage
growth could raise domestic inflationary pressure in the
medium term, but if wage growth remains subdued, inflation
could fall below the 2% target once the upward impetus from
import prices washes out. Overall, however, the risks around
the projection are judged to be balanced (Table 5.G).
Charts 5.12 and 5.13 show the MPC’s projections under the
alternative constant rate assumption, and the policy package
announced by the MPC. That assumption is that Bank Rate
remains at 0.25% throughout the three years of the forecast
period, before rising towards the market path over the
subsequent three years. Under that path, relative to the
market rate profile, the growth and inflation projections are
slightly higher.

42 Inflation Report February 2017
Other forecasters’ expectations
This box reports the results of the Bank’s most recent survey
of external forecasters, carried out in January.(1) On average,
respondents expected four-quarter GDP growth to slow
materially over the coming year, before picking up to around
1¾% over the following two years (Table 1). That average
GDP growth forecast was slightly stronger at the one year
ahead horizon and slightly weaker further ahead, relative to
expectations three months ago. When compared to the time
of the May Report, before the EU referendum, the average of
respondents’ central projection for GDP growth in one year’s
time was more than 1 percentage point lower, and growth in
three years’ time was 0.3 percentage points lower (Chart A).
On average, external forecasters thought there was a
two-thirds probability of CPI inflation being at or above the
2% target in two years’ time. That was broadly similar to their
projections in November. However, the average weight placed
on inflation being at or above 2.5% at that horizon was slightly
lower (Chart B).
External forecasters, on average, expected a slightly tighter
monetary stance over the next three years compared with the
time of the November Report (Chart C). The average of
external forecasters’ central projections was that Bank Rate
would rise to around 0.7% by 2020 Q1 (Table 1). The stock of
gilt purchases was expected, on average, to be close to the
£435 billion announced in August. Respondents, on average,
expected the stock of corporate bonds to be £10 billion over
the forecast period, £2 billion less than expected at the time of
the November Report.
