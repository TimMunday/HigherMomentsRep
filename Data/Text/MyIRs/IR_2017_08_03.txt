Inflation Report
August 2017

In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.
Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy,
including its objectives for growth and employment.
The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of
the Monetary Policy Committee. It serves two purposes. First, its preparation provides a
comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid
to our decision-making. Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the
reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect.
Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are
based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths
for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central
projections.
This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with
section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Monetary Policy Summary i
Monetary Policy Summary
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the
2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its
meeting ending on 2 August 2017, the MPC voted by a majority of 6–2 to maintain Bank Rate
at 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial
investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank
reserves, at £10 billion. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of
UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at
£435 billion. The Committee voted unanimously to close the drawdown period for the
Term Funding Scheme (TFS) on 28 February 2018, as envisaged when the scheme was
introduced.
The MPC’s overall assessment of the outlook for inflation and activity in the August Inflation Report is broadly similar to
that in May. In the MPC’s central forecast, GDP growth remains sluggish in the near term as the squeeze on households’
real incomes continues to weigh on consumption. Growth then picks up to just above its reduced potential rate over the
balance of the forecast period. Net trade and business investment firm up, and consumption growth recovers in line with
modestly rising household incomes. Net trade is bolstered by strong global growth and the past depreciation of sterling.
The combination of high rates of profitability, especially in the export sector, the low cost of capital and limited spare
capacity supports investment by UK firms over the forecast period, offsetting the effect of continued uncertainties
around Brexit.
CPI inflation rose to 2.6% in June from 2.3% in March, as expected. The MPC expects inflation to rise further in coming
months and to peak around 3% in October, as the past depreciation of sterling continues to pass through to consumer
prices. Conditional on the current market yield curve, inflation is projected to remain above the MPC’s target throughout
the forecast period. This overshoot reflects entirely the effects of the referendum-related falls in sterling. As the effect
of rising import prices on inflation diminishes, domestic inflationary pressures gradually pick up over the forecast period.
As slack is absorbed, wage growth is projected to recover. In addition, margins in the consumer sector, having been
squeezed by the pickup in import prices, are projected to be rebuilt. Consequently, inflation remains at a level slightly
above the 2% target.
As in previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the
United Kingdom’s eventual trading relationship with the European Union. The projections also assume that, in the
interim, households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading
relationship. Other important judgements include: that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices
broadly as projected, and without adverse consequences for inflation expectations further ahead; that regular pay
growth remains modest in the near term but picks up over the forecast period; and that subdued household spending
growth is largely balanced by a pickup in other components of demand.
Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new
international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over
the next few years. Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the
cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth. For this reason, the MPC’s remit
specifies that, in exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it
intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. 
ii Inflation Report August 2017
Through most of the forecast period, the economy operates with a small degree of spare capacity and CPI inflation is well
above the target. By the end of the forecast, that trade-off is eliminated. Spare capacity is fully absorbed, and inflation
remains above the target.
The Committee judges that, given the assumptions underlying its projections including the closure of the drawdown
period of the TFS, and allowing for the effects of the recent prudential decisions of the Financial Policy Committee and
the Prudential Regulation Authority, some tightening of monetary policy would be required to achieve a sustainable
return of inflation to the target. Specifically, if the economy follows a path broadly consistent with the August central
projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than
the path implied by the yield curve underlying the August projections.
In light of these considerations, six members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the
demands of the MPC’s remit. Two members considered it appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points. All
members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. The
Committee will continue to monitor closely the incoming evidence, and stands ready to respond to changes in the
economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.
Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 1
1 Global economic and financial
market developments
The outlook for the global economy has improved in recent quarters, as growth has picked up and
its composition has rotated towards investment. The improving outlook, alongside greater investor
risk appetite, has supported rises in equity and corporate bond prices over the past year. Financial
market prices imply that UK and euro-area policy rates are expected to rise more quickly than they
had been in May, although the pace remains gradual. Sterling’s exchange rate has fallen slightly
since May and remains significantly below its level prior to the EU referendum.
Global GDP growth is estimated to have risen further in
2017 Q2 and is projected to be stable in coming quarters
(Section 1.1). Part of the pickup in growth since 2016 H1 has
been accounted for by a recovery in investment growth
(Chart 1.1), which should support the outlook for activity
further ahead. While the near-term outlook is broadly
unchanged since May, it remains stronger than projected in
earlier Reports. Despite further falls in unemployment across a
number of countries, wage growth and global inflation remain
relatively subdued (Section 1.2).
Improvements in the outlook for global growth have been
reflected in rising equity prices and narrower corporate bond
spreads. Benchmark market interest rates have increased
(Section 1.3). Despite the firmer global backdrop, investors
appear to have marked down UK growth prospects since the
EU referendum. The sterling ERI has remained 15%–20%
below its late-2015 peak. In addition, the risk premium on
UK equities does not appear to have fallen in line with
international equivalents. The market-implied path for
Bank Rate rises only very gradually over the next three years,
albeit by slightly more than in the run-up to the May Report.
1.1 Developments in global activity
Quarterly global GDP growth, weighted by countries’ shares
in UK exports, is estimated to have picked up from 0.6% in
2017 Q1 to 0.7% in Q2. Euro-area growth has continued to
strengthen, while US growth recovered in Q2 from an
erratically weak Q1 (Table 1.A). Growth in emerging market
economies (EMEs) is expected to have been stable in 2017 H1,
having slowed in recent years.
A range of indicators suggest continued momentum in global
growth in the near term. Global survey indicators of output
and new orders remain robust. Business and consumer
confidence are also buoyant, particularly in the euro area and
United States (Chart 1.2). Another indicator of the recovery

2 Inflation Report August 2017
in activity has been a sharp pickup in world trade growth
(Chart 1.3). While that largely reflects stronger trade growth
across EMEs, trade growth also appears to be recovering across
advanced economies.
As the recovery has progressed, the composition of
advanced-economy GDP growth appears to have rotated
towards investment (Chart 1.4). Consumption growth was
the main driver of the recovery in recent years, but investment
growth has gathered pace since late 2016. Historically,
investment growth has been relatively synchronised across
advanced economies (Chart 1.1). A rise in US and euro-area
capital goods orders in the first half of this year suggests that
the pickup in investment growth is likely to be sustained in the
near term. The level of advanced-economy investment
remains low, however. That means growth in the capital stock
remains subdued, which will continue to drag on global
productivity growth.
The euro area
Quarterly euro-area GDP growth has strengthened over the
past twelve months, and at 0.6% in 2017 Q2 was around its
pre-crisis average rate (Table 1.A). The pickup in growth has
been broad-based across countries and accounted for by
stronger private domestic demand, particularly business
investment. Alongside accommodative monetary policy and
easing credit conditions, GDP growth appears to have been
supported by improving business and consumer confidence
(Chart 1.2).
Euro-area growth is projected to remain a little above ½% per
quarter in the near term. That is consistent with continued
robust survey indicators of near-term activity and confidence.
The pace of growth should also support a continued increase
in employment. The euro-area unemployment rate has fallen
to 9.1% and is projected to continue to fall slightly in the
near term.
The United States
US GDP growth has been broadly stable in recent years, with
growth continuing to average around ½% per quarter in
2017 H1 (Table 1.A). There was, however, some volatility in
growth, as temporary factors depressed consumption growth
in Q1. Looking through that, consumption has been a little
weaker than expected in May, perhaps in part reflecting
continued subdued wage growth (Section 1.2). In contrast,
investment growth has been strong and broadly in line with
expectations.
Quarterly US GDP growth is expected to remain around ½%
in the second half of this year. With the US unemployment
rate close to its pre-crisis trough, it appears that slack in the
US labour market has largely been absorbed. The
sustainability of US growth is therefore likely to depend in
large part on productivity trends. Productivity growth has

begun to pick up, but only gradually, and it remains
significantly below pre-crisis rates. Business investment
growth in the United States has tended to outperform that
in other advanced economies over recent years, and should
support US productivity growth over time.
Emerging market economies
Four-quarter growth in China has been broadly stable over
the past two years and was 6.9% in 2017 Q2 (Table 1.A).
Industrial production growth has been strong, in part
reflecting the strength of global demand. Domestic demand
growth has also been resilient, although that has been
supported by rapid credit growth, raising concerns about
financial stability over the medium term. There remain
significant challenges for the authorities in maintaining current
rates of GDP growth while managing and reducing those risks
to financial stability.(1)
Having slowed significantly in preceding years, growth in
other EMEs has continued to recover over the past year.
Russia and Brazil, which have accounted for much of the
slowing in recent years, appear to have emerged from
recession, although the outlook for Brazil remains
vulnerable to political risks. Recoveries in world trade
and advanced-economy demand growth should also help
to support EME growth. Nevertheless, growth is expected
to remain below pre-crisis rates.
Growth in many EMEs has been supported by an easing in
financial conditions and, for commodity exporters, the rise in
commodity prices since early 2016 (Section 1.2). Net inflows
of private sector capital into EMEs have picked up slightly in
the first half of this year and EME equity prices have risen
further. Several major EMEs appear to have increased their
resilience to macroeconomic shocks, with current account
deficits narrowing, foreign exchange reserves rising, and
government finances becoming somewhat less reliant on
commodity production.
1.2 Commodity markets and developments
in inflation
The improving outlook for global economic activity appears
to have pushed up some commodity prices. In particular,
industrial metals prices have risen slightly since May and are
significantly higher than a year ago (Chart 1.5).
By contrast, oil prices have fallen in recent months as
developments in oil supply appear to have outweighed
stronger demand prospects. US dollar oil prices have fallen by
8% since the run-up to the May Report (Chart 1.5). Market

contacts point to unexpected resilience in US shale oil
production as a key driver of those falls in prices. Although
OPEC agreed in May to extend supply cuts until March 2018,
the International Energy Agency expects non-OPEC
production, including that in the United States, to grow
broadly in line with global demand next year.
Past rises in commodity prices have pushed up measures
of headline consumer price inflation in the euro area,
United States and more widely (Table 1.B). That largely
reflects a rise in global oil prices in the first half of 2016,
following falls in 2014–15 (Chart 1.5). As those rises have
started to drop out of the annual comparison, however, the
boost to headline inflation has begun to diminish.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, remains
subdued in the euro area and United States (Table 1.B). The
extent of that weakness has to some degree been masked
recently by erratic factors. Euro-area inflation had been
boosted temporarily by the timing of Easter holidays relative
to 2016, but that effect has now unwound. US core inflation
had been pushed up by a sharp rise in prescription drug prices.
That has now fallen out of the annual inflation rate, although a
decline in the cost of mobile phone services is depressing core
inflation at present.
One indicator of core inflation in the medium term is
developments in companies’ wage cost pressures. US wage
growth picked up during 2014, but has remained broadly
stable since then at a somewhat subdued rate (Chart 1.6).
Euro-area wage growth has remained weak in recent years,
perhaps reflecting a persistent degree of labour market slack.
With unemployment set to decline further in the euro area,
however, and seemingly little slack in the United States at
present, wage growth and broader inflationary pressures are
projected to increase. That said, there is some uncertainty
around how quickly and the extent to which wage growth will
pick up.
Inflation trends globally have some bearing on those in the
United Kingdom. Annual world export price inflation
excluding oil picked up sharply in 2017 Q1, and is expected to
have remained elevated in Q2 at 3.6% (Table 1.B). That is
pushing up UK import price inflation (Section 4), as is the past
fall in sterling. But as past rises in commodity prices begin to
drop out of the annual comparison, and the more recent falls
in oil prices are passed through into lower input costs for other
goods, world export price inflation is expected to slow around
the turn of the year.
1.3 Developments in financial markets
The improvement in global economic prospects and investors’
perceptions of risks around the outlook have been key drivers
of financial asset prices.

Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 5
Interest rates
The improving growth outlook has been reflected in higher
market interest rates across advanced economies over the
past year. And UK and euro-area long-term interest rates
(Chart 1.7) and market-implied paths for policy rates
(Chart 1.8) have risen further since May. In contrast,
US market interest rates were broadly unchanged over
the past three months, although they remain higher than
a year ago.
In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) in June again raised the target range for the federal
funds rate, to between 1% and 1¼%. The median FOMC
member’s projection is for the federal funds rate to rise to a
little below 3% by the end of 2019. The FOMC also
announced that, subject to economic conditions, it expects to
begin to unwind its asset purchase programme. Market
interest rates imply that the pace of rate rises will slow over
the next few years (Chart 1.8), to a level below the median
FOMC member’s policy rate projection.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has made no changes to
policy rates or its asset purchase programme since May. In
July, the ECB reiterated that it would continue its programme
of asset purchases until December 2017 and market contacts
expect them to continue beyond that point but with a
reduction in the pace of purchase. The market-implied path
for policy rates steepened somewhat towards the end of June,
but still rises only gradually over the next three years
(Chart 1.8).
In the United Kingdom, the market-implied path for Bank Rate
reaches 0.8% in three years’ time, around 20 basis points
higher than at the time of the May Report (Chart 1.8). Within
that, a full 25 basis point rise in Bank Rate is now implied by
late 2018.
The MPC voted 5–3 to make no changes to monetary policy
at its June meeting, as set out in the box on page 6. Market
contacts attributed subsequent rises in interest rate
expectations to changes in the balance of policy votes and
later communications by MPC members. The details of the
August decision are contained in the Monetary Policy
Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and in more detail
in the Minutes of the meeting.
Market-implied paths continue to suggest that policy rates in
advanced economies will rise only gradually in coming years
(Chart 1.8), and long-term government bond yields remain
historically low (Chart 1.7). These low levels of long-term
interest rates are likely in part to reflect continued subdued
expectations for long-term growth, and the risk of even
weaker growth, despite the recent improvement in
nearer-term prospects. But low levels of long-term interest
rates are also likely to reflect structural shifts in global

6 Inflation Report August 2017
Monetary policy since the May Report
The MPC’s central projection in the May Report was for
four-quarter GDP growth to slow over 2017, settling at around
1¾% over the rest of the forecast period. Subdued
consumption growth was projected to be largely balanced by
rising net trade and investment. Inflation was projected to
remain above the 2% target, reflecting higher import prices
stemming from the past depreciation of sterling. Conditional
on the path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates
prevailing at the time, wage growth and domestic price
pressures were projected to pick up over the forecast, such
that inflation was projected to be rising in the third year even
as external price pressures faded. That central projection was
also conditioned on the announced Term Funding Scheme,
and on the stocks of purchased gilts and corporate bonds
remaining at £435 billion and £10 billion respectively.
At its meeting ending on 14 June, the MPC noted that
GDP growth had declined markedly in 2017 Q1, in part
reflecting weaker household spending. It remained to be seen
how large and persistent this slowdown in consumption would
prove, with mixed signals from various indicators. For
instance, there had been further signs of a slowing in the
housing market but consumer confidence had remained
relatively resilient. Surveys of exports and investment,
however, were fairly upbeat. That in part reflected robust
near-term momentum in global activity.
CPI inflation had reached 2.9% in May, and core inflation had
also risen. Both stood at rates above the MPC’s expectations
at the time of the May Report. In contrast, wage growth had
moderated further in April from already subdued rates, even as
the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6%.
The MPC’s May projections showed that the economy was
expected to operate with a small degree of spare capacity for
most of the forecast period, justifying the tolerance of some
degree of above-target inflation. The continued growth of
employment could suggest that spare capacity was being
eroded, lessening the trade-off the MPC was required to
balance. Key considerations would be the evolution of
inflationary pressures, the persistence of weaker consumption
and the degree to which it was offset by other components of
demand. In light of those considerations, five members
thought the current policy stance remained appropriate to
balance that trade-off. Three members considered it
appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points. All
members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate were
expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.
investment and saving preferences, due to factors such as the
increasing average age of the global population.(1)
Exchange rates
Changes in relative growth prospects and interest rates tend
to be associated with movements in exchange rates. Amid
improving euro-area growth prospects, the euro has
appreciated against a range of currencies in recent months,
including sterling (Chart 1.9).
Sterling has remained around 15%–20% below its
November 2015 peak since the EU referendum (Chart 1.9).
In the run-up to the August Report, the sterling ERI was 2%
lower than at the time of the May Report, and 18% below
its peak. Market contacts ascribe much of the fall to changes
in investors’ perceptions of the UK growth outlook and risks
around the United Kingdom’s departure from the
European Union.
Corporate capital markets
Developments in capital markets matter for the ease and cost
of raising finance for companies. The improvement in the
global growth outlook over the past year (Section 1.1),

combined with greater investor risk appetite, appears to have
supported a significant rise in international equity prices
(Chart 1.10). Model-based estimates of equity risk premia,
which aim to capture the additional return that investors
demand over and above the returns on government bonds,
have fallen significantly since mid-2016 for US and euro-area
equities (Chart 1.11). In addition, measures of implied asset
price volatility — one set of indicators of financial market
uncertainty and risk aversion — have also fallen, although
as explained in the box on page 8 these indicators can be
influenced by other factors.
The cost of debt financing through capital markets also
remains low. Companies issuing debt typically pay a spread
relative to government bond yields, to compensate investors
for additional risk. While government bond yields have risen
over the past year (Chart 1.7), spreads on corporate bonds
have narrowed (Chart 1.12). Moreover, the spreads on
corporate bonds for riskier ‘high-yield’ companies have
narrowed by more than for other companies. Those
developments probably reflect a reduction in downside risks
to the global outlook following the recent period of steady
growth (Section 1.1), and increased investor appetite for risk.
Compared with those in the euro area and United States,
risky assets in the United Kingdom have underperformed.
An estimate of the risk premium on equities within the
FTSE All-Share index is broadly unchanged from a year ago,
in contrast to the falls in risk premia for other major global
equity indices (Chart 1.11). Much of the rise in the
FTSE All-Share index (Chart 1.10) appears instead to have
reflected a sharper rise in earnings expectations. In turn, that
probably stems from the boost to the sterling value of foreign
currency profits due to the depreciation, rather than a
relatively greater improvement in their underlying earnings.
Within the FTSE All-Share, the equity prices of UK-focused
companies have not risen to the same extent as for other
companies (Chart 1.13). And the spreads on high-yield
sterling bonds, which are more likely to be issued by
domestically focused firms, have narrowed but by less than
their dollar and euro equivalents since early 2016 (Chart 1.12).
Bank funding costs
Capital markets also matter for broader credit conditions
through their influence on bank funding costs. While market
interest rates have risen in recent quarters, the spreads that
banks pay for funding over and above benchmark interest rates
have continued to narrow (Chart 1.14), largely reflecting the
broader improvement in investor risk sentiment.
At its June meeting, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC)
decided to increase the countercyclical capital buffer rate,
levied on banks’ total risk-weighted UK assets, from 0% to
0.5% and said that it expected — absent a material change in

8 Inflation Report August 2017
Why are measures of financial market
uncertainty close to historical lows?
The cost of finance for companies will depend, in part, on
investors’ willingness to take on risk and their perceptions of
the degree of risk.
One set of financial market-based measures of investor
uncertainty and risk aversion are implied volatilities. These
measures have fallen over the past year. For example, the
VIX measure of implied equity volatility, derived from
S&P 500 stock index option prices, is close to its historical
lows (Chart A). And this trend has broadly been replicated
in implied volatilities for a wider range of financial assets,
including bonds and currencies.
The current low level of implied volatilities may, however, be
understating the degree of uncertainty influencing investors’
decisions. Other measures of uncertainty, such as the Baker,
Bloom and Davis index of global economic policy uncertainty
based on media citations, are above average at present
(Chart A). That index has tended to be closely correlated with
financial market measures of uncertainty in the past.(1)
One reason why implied volatilities may be understating
uncertainty is if they are affected by particular market-based
factors. One factor that may have lowered implied volatilities
in recent years is investors using option-based strategies to
generate higher returns in the low interest rate environment.
In particular, there are reports of some investors becoming
more willing to sell insurance against rises or falls in asset
prices to generate additional revenue. This may have reduced
the price of that insurance and therefore the level of implied
volatility calculated from them. Underlying perceptions of risk
could therefore be higher than indicated by measures of
implied volatility, although a greater willingness to sell
insurance relative to demand could also suggest an increase in
risk appetite among investors.
In addition, the options underlying these estimates of implied
volatilities tend to be traded over shorter horizons than those
over which investment decisions are made. The VIX measure,
for example, only reflects uncertainty over the next 30 days.
So these measures may be less affected by longer-term risks,
even though those risks may be affecting other asset prices
and investment decisions.
Nevertheless, market contacts primarily point to positive
global growth developments to explain the recent continued
decline in implied volatilities. A global economy seemingly on
a firmer footing may have alleviated some of the uncertainty
around the outlook. In addition, low levels of implied volatility
could reflect perceptions that the global economy is less
vulnerable to shocks than it may have been in the recent past.
For example, a more resilient financial system should reduce
the risk that negative economic developments will be
amplified through a tightening in financial conditions. Low
implied volatilities may also be associated with investors’
belief in the ability of monetary policy makers to mitigate
downside risks to growth.
Overall, the current low levels of implied volatilities are likely
to reflect to some extent an improvement in risk sentiment
among investors, which should help to support financing
conditions for companies. Many of these measures of
uncertainty can be volatile, however, and subject to sudden
shifts in sentiment.

growth, see Forbes, K (2016), ‘Uncertainty about uncertainty’;

10 Inflation Report August 2017
2 Demand and output
Output growth slowed in the first half of 2017. Much of that slowing appears to have been driven
by weaker growth in household spending, as sterling’s depreciation weighed on real income growth.
Net trade has been volatile, but the depreciation and the strength in global demand are expected to
provide support. Business investment growth has picked up a little and, together with net trade, is
projected to offset part of the weakness from household spending.
Sterling has depreciated sharply since the EU referendum and,
in the run‑up to the August Report, was 18% lower than its
November 2015 peak. That is raising UK import prices
(Section 4), reducing households’ purchasing power and
weighing on their consumption. Combined with the strength
of global demand, however, the depreciation should also
support growth in exports and investment in export capacity.
A key factor affecting the outlook for GDP growth is the
extent to which lower growth in household spending is offset
by net trade and business investment growth. That will also
be influenced by how households and companies anticipate
and respond to the prospect of the United Kingdom’s
departure from the European Union.
GDP growth slowed sharply in 2017 Q1, to 0.2% (Chart 2.1),
and remained sluggish at 0.3% in Q2. The GDP backcast,
which takes into account the revision properties of the official
data and information from business surveys, suggests that
growth in Q1 was higher, at 0.4%. The MPC projects growth
to be unrevised at 0.3% in Q2.
The slowdown in growth since 2016 has been mainly
accounted for by slower growth in service sector output. That
is likely in part to reflect weak growth in household
consumption (Section 2.1), although output in
consumer‑facing sectors such as retail trade bounced back
somewhat in Q2. Consumption is projected to remain
subdued in coming quarters, as real income growth remains
weak and households continue to adjust to past falls in their
purchasing power.
According to official estimates, manufacturing output fell a
little in Q2, reflecting a decline in motor vehicle production.
Manufacturing activity is expected to improve in the near
term, however, reflecting the support to UK exports from
sterling’s depreciation and the strength in global demand
(Section 2.2). That may also provide some support to business
investment by firms in the tradable sector of the economy
(Section 2.3).

Section 2 Demand and output 11
GDP growth is projected to remain at 0.3% in Q3. Survey
indicators of expected activity growth weakened somewhat in
Q2 (Chart 2.2), which on its own would point to a slight
slowing in growth in Q3. Set against that, however, the levels
of survey indicators of current and expected growth have been
consistent with stronger growth than the official data in recent
quarters. Much of that strength relative to the official data is
concentrated in the manufacturing sector and is at odds with
the fall in manufacturing output in Q2.
2.1 Household spending
The 18% depreciation of sterling since November 2015 is
raising UK import prices (Section 4) and weighing on
household real income growth (Chart 2.3). The pace at which
households moderate their spending in response will be a key
determinant of the outlook for overall GDP growth.
Household spending growth slowed in Q1 to 0.4% (Table 2.A).
That was slightly stronger than expected in May, and much
stronger than total household real income which fell by 1.3%
in Q1. As a consequence, the household saving ratio fell from
3.3% to 1.7%, its lowest level since the series began in 1963.
Part of the sharp fall in real income was caused by a temporary
increase in the amount paid in taxes on dividends, however.
The effective rate of tax on dividends was raised in April 2016.
That led to some dividend payments being brought forward
ahead of that date, much of the tax on which was paid in
2017 Q1. Tax payments are expected to have fallen back in
Q2, and so real income and the saving ratio are expected to
have bounced back slightly. As described in the box on
pages 16–17 of the May Report, the ONS has announced
changes to the measurement of dividend income ahead of
Blue Book 2017 which mean that the amount of dividend
income received by households — and hence the saving ratio
— will be revised up. Revised estimates for recent years will be
published in August 2017.(1)
Indicators of household spending in Q2 have been mixed.
Retail sales picked up, following a fall in Q1. And energy
consumption is likely to have weighed on overall consumption
growth by less than in Q1, when it was weaker than usual as a
result of relatively warmer weather. But spending on larger
items, such as cars, appears to have fallen. Private new car
registrations, for example, fell by 16% in the three months to
June relative to a year earlier (Chart 2.4), although part of that
fall is likely to have reflected the impact of changes to vehicle
tax rates that came into effect in April. In addition, contacts of
the Bank’s Agents reported that spending on large items such
as homeware has slowed, and respondents to the

12 Inflation Report August 2017
CBI Distributive Trades Survey reported that sales of household
electrical goods fell over the year to June.
The pace at which households adjust their consumption to
slowing rates of real income growth will depend on a number
of factors. In the short run, households may change the
amount they save or borrow to allow for only a gradual
adjustment. The extent to which households can do that,
however, will depend in part on their current holdings of
savings and debt, which vary significantly across households
(see the box on pages 14–15).
The extent to which households borrow in order to fund
spending may also be affected by consumer credit conditions.
These have eased in recent years, as banks’ funding costs have
fallen (Section 1) and competition between lenders has
increased. Interest rates on a £10,000 personal loan are close
to record lows (Table 2.B) and the average interest‑free period
on credit card balance transfers has doubled since 2011.
Lenders responding to the Credit Conditions Survey reported
that unsecured credit availability had tightened modestly in
Q2 and was expected to tighten further in Q3,(1) although the
level of competition between lenders remains strong.
Four‑quarter growth in consumer credit has slowed slightly
since late 2016, although it remained high at around 10% in
Q2 (Chart 2.5). Dealership car finance accounted for a little
over a third of that growth, with the remainder accounted for
by credit card and other borrowing, such as personal loans.(2)
The Prudential Regulation Authority’s (PRA’s) review of
consumer credit lending, published in July, found that the
resilience of lenders’ consumer credit portfolios had been
falling.(3) Lenders with material exposures to consumer credit
will be asked to respond to that review. In addition, the
Financial Policy Committee (FPC) is bringing forward the
assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in
the Bank’s 2017 annual stress test, in order to inform the
assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience
required in aggregate against this lending. The FPC increased
the countercyclical capital buffer rate, levied on banks’ total
risk‑weighted UK assets, from 0% to 0.5%. It expected —
absent a material change in the outlook — to raise the rate to
1% at its November meeting (Section 1).(4)
The pace at which households adjust their spending growth in
response to the squeeze in real incomes will also depend on
their expectations for future income growth. Having remained
broadly stable in the preceding months, the GfK measure of

Section 2 Demand and output 13
consumer confidence fell in June to a little below its historical
average and remained there in July (Chart 2.4). That fall was
driven by lower household confidence in the general economic
situation, as well as a fall in the net balance of households
reporting that now is the right time to make major purchases.
In contrast, the net balance of households expecting their
financial situation to improve over the year ahead has
remained broadly unchanged, at a little above its past average.
The housing market can also reflect households’ income
expectations, since those expectations tend to affect the
amount households are willing to spend on a new home.
Activity and house price inflation have weakened further since
May and are projected to remain weak in coming quarters (see
the box on pages 17–18). These developments are consistent
with subdued household spending growth in the near term.
Overall, consumption growth is projected to remain subdued
in coming quarters, broadly as expected in May (Table 2.C).
That reflects continued weak real income growth due to rises
in import prices (Section 4) and subdued wage growth
(Section 3), as well as a further adjustment by households to
the past weakness in real income growth. Further ahead,
consumption growth is projected to rise gradually as wage
growth starts to pick up and the drag from sterling’s
depreciation on real income growth wanes (Section 5).
2.2 Net trade and the current account
Exports
While sterling’s depreciation has weighed on household real
income growth, it will have supported margins for exporters.
Together with the boost provided by the recent strength in
global demand (Section 1), that is likely to support growth in
export volumes. The outlook for export growth will also
depend on any changes to the United Kingdom’s trading
arrangements and how companies anticipate and respond to
these (Section 5).
Between the end of 2015 and 2017 Q1, export prices fell by
5% in foreign currency terms, suggesting some increase in
competitiveness. But they rose by 13% in sterling terms,
meaning that exporters’ margins are likely to have increased.
Consistent with that, survey measures of margins on exports
have picked up in recent months. The Agents’ profit margin
company visit scores, for example, have generally been above
normal for export‑focused companies since late 2016, while
those for domestic‑focused companies have remained below
normal. The rise in export margins is likely to support an
expansion in export volumes among firms with spare capacity.
As that capacity is eroded, and for firms with limited spare
capacity, those higher margins should provide an incentive to
invest (Section 2.3), thereby boosting export volumes over
time.

14 Inflation Report August 2017
How might households respond to the real
income squeeze?
Household purchasing power has fallen in recent months as
sterling’s depreciation has pushed up the prices of imported
goods and services. A key factor for the outlook for
GDP growth is the speed and extent to which households
adjust their spending in response. This is likely to depend on a
number of factors including their holdings of savings and debt.
Households with larger savings might be able to reduce
spending by less in the short term, by running down those
savings or by saving less each month. In contrast, those with
higher debt may need to reduce spending more quickly in
order to continue to meet their debt repayments, particularly
if those repayments are high relative to their incomes. This
box examines evidence on how different households are likely
to respond to falls in their real incomes using the results of the
latest household survey carried out for the Bank by
NMG Consulting in May.
Households were asked how they would adjust spending in
response to a 5% rise in the prices of all the goods and services
they consumed.(1) Although not identical, this situation is
similar to the current squeeze in real incomes caused by
sterling’s depreciation. The possible responses fell into three
main categories. First, households could respond that they
would buy the same goods and services as they do currently,
even though they cost more. That would mean maintaining
spending in real terms and increasing it in nominal terms.
Second, households could respond that they would spend
extra on some goods and services while cutting back on
others. That would mean reducing spending in real terms but
by less than the fall in real income, such that nominal spending
still increased. And third, households could respond that they
would spend no more than they do currently in nominal terms,
such that real spending falls by at least as much as the fall in
real income. Around a third of respondents fell into each of
these three categories (Chart A).
The survey results suggest that households who would reduce
real spending the most tended to have fewer savings and be
more concerned about their debt. Chart A shows that around
half of those who reported that they would spend no more
than they do currently in nominal terms had less than £1,200
of savings. In contrast, 60% of those who would maintain
their spending in real terms had over £15,000 of savings.
Those who reported that they would cut real spending also
tended to hold more debt, and to be more concerned about
that debt.
Those households who would increase nominal spending in
response to the fall in their real income would need to pay for
that extra spending. The majority of these households
reported that they would run down their savings, or save less
each month (Chart B). In contrast, fewer than 10% would
borrow in order to finance the increase. Consistent with the
fact that they tend to have fewer savings, a larger proportion
(1) The scenario was: ‘We’d like you to imagine a scenario where the price of all goods
and services you buy increased for a sustained period. Imagine the cost of everything
— food, clothes, travel costs, getting your hair cut, getting the car washed etc —
increased by 5% from tomorrow. Please assume your income would not be any
higher unless you take action to increase it’.

Section 2 Demand and output 15
of households who would partially cut real spending reported
that they would fund the extra nominal spending by working
more (Section 3).
Over time, households will need to adjust their spending
towards the lower level of their real income. The responses to
the NMG survey suggest that households in aggregate will
adjust spending only gradually. In addition, the variation
between responses means that the overall impact will depend
in part on which types of households have experienced the
largest squeeze in their real incomes and how much of
aggregate spending those households account for. The MPC
will continue to monitor both the aggregate response to the
real income squeeze, and how that response appears to be
varying across households.
UK export volumes fell in Q1 (Table 2.A), but that largely
reflected a fallback in exports of non‑monetary gold following
a sharp rise in Q4. This is a volatile component of net trade
which is offset by same‑sized movements in private sector
investment in valuables.(1) Excluding the impact of
non‑monetary gold and other valuables, UK exports rose by
0.7% in Q1, and by 3% over the year to Q1 (Chart 2.6). That
was lower than expected in May, reflecting weak growth in
services exports, although growth in goods exports was
relatively strong.
Export volumes are projected to grow modestly in the near
term. That growth is a little stronger than expected in May,
reflecting the further depreciation of sterling since then
(Section 1). Consistent with that, survey measures of export
orders and deliveries have continued to rise (Chart 2.7).
Imports and the current account
Although sterling’s depreciation has raised the price of
imported goods and services (Section 4), growth in UK imports
has nevertheless outstripped growth in exports since 2016 H2
(Chart 2.6). As a consequence, and excluding the impact of
non‑monetary gold and other valuables, net trade subtracted
0.4 percentage points from GDP in Q1.
Import growth is projected to slow a little in coming quarters.
When combined with the expected growth in exports, this
means that net trade is projected to provide a small boost to
GDP growth over the remainder of 2017, broadly as expected
in May. That offsets part of the near‑term weakness in
household spending growth (Section 2.1).
The weakness in net trade meant that the current account
deficit — which reflects the balance of nominal trade flows
and other payments between the United Kingdom and the rest
of the world — widened to 3.4% of GDP in Q1 (Chart 2.8).
A small part of that widening was also due to an increase in
the deficit on primary income, the net value of investment
income received by UK residents. The current account deficit
is expected to have remained at around that level in Q2.

2.3 Business investment
The strength in global demand and sterling’s depreciation are
likely to increase firms’ incentives to invest in export capacity.
Following a fall over 2016, business investment is estimated to
have risen by 0.6% in Q1 (Table 2.A), broadly as expected in
May. Investment is projected to continue to grow at a solid
pace in the near term, albeit by a little less than projected in
May (Table 2.C). That is broadly consistent with surveys of
investment intentions, some of which weakened a little in Q2
(Chart 2.9).
In addition to the boost provided by the strength of global
demand, the rate of return on capital as measured by the ONS
remains high and spare capacity is limited. Financing conditions
may also provide some support to investment in the near term.
Both the cost of corporate bond issuance (Section 1) and the
cost of bank loans for businesses have fallen since the start of
2016, although increases in market interest rates have raised the
cost of bond issuance more recently and are likely to exert some
upwards pressure on the cost of bank loans in coming quarters.
Overall net finance raised by companies picked up in Q2, having
been relatively weak in the previous two quarters (Chart 2.10).
Set against the support for investment from global conditions
and financing costs, sterling’s depreciation is likely to raise the
cost of investment because, with the exception of buildings
(around one quarter of the total), investment is relatively
import‑intensive.
In addition, the anticipation of Brexit and related uncertainties
are likely to dampen investment growth somewhat. Two fifths
of respondents to a recent CBI survey on investment reported
that Brexit had negatively affected their investment decisions.
And the Bank’s Agents report that uncertainty surrounding the
United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements has meant that
some larger firms, and those more exposed to a potential
change in trading arrangements, have been delaying medium
and longer‑term investment plans. Some firms have
considered relocating elements of activity to other countries,
or refocusing investment outside the United Kingdom, in order
to mitigate any adverse impacts.
Taken as a whole, investment is projected to grow less strongly
than would have been expected given the strength in global and
financial conditions (Section 5). Investment remains weak
relative to the size of the capital stock and so the capital stock is
projected to expand only slowly over the forecast period.
2.4 Government spending
The MPC’s forecasts are conditioned on the Government’s tax
and spending plans detailed in the Spring 2017 Budget. Under
those plans, the fiscal consolidation is set to continue. That
weighs on overall GDP growth over the MPC’s forecast period.

Recent developments in the housing market
UK housing market activity and house price inflation have
slowed over the past 18 months, and that slowdown has
gathered pace since the start of the year. House prices were
broadly flat in Q2 (top panel of Chart A). And mortgage
approvals fell to around 65,000 per month (middle panel of
Chart A), weaker than expected in May. In contrast, new
house building has been robust, with housing starts having
increased by 26% in the year to 2017 Q1 (bottom panel of
Chart A). This box explores some of the possible drivers of
these developments, together with their implications for the
near‑term outlook.
Explaining the recent weakness in the housing market
Much of the weakness in housing market activity over the past
18 months reflects a fall in the number of buy‑to‑let property
transactions following policy changes such as the introduction
of the stamp duty charge for additional properties in
April 2016. Buy‑to‑let mortgage completions fell sharply in
April 2016 (middle panel of Chart A) and have remained
broadly flat since then. Perhaps consistent with that, the
slowdown in housing market activity over the past 18 months
has been particularly pronounced in London and the
South East, which together account for around 50% of
buy‑to‑let transactions. Activity may also have been affected
by uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum.
The most recent falls in house prices and activity do not
appear to have been driven by weakness in the buy‑to‑let
market, however. The latest fall in mortgage approvals has
largely reflected falls in the number of homemovers and
first‑time buyers. And the slowdown appears to have been a
little more broad‑based across regions, with contacts of the
Bank’s Agents reporting that housing demand has softened in
many parts of the United Kingdom in recent months.
That more widespread slowdown is likely to have been driven
by some of the same factors driving the weakness in spending,
in particular the weakness in income growth (Section 2.1).
Since households tend to have some flexibility in moving
house, they may choose to delay moving or to reduce the
amount they are willing to spend following a period of weak
income growth, especially if they are uncertain about their
likely income levels in the longer term. That may particularly
constrain activity in areas such as London and the South East,
where house prices are higher relative to incomes.(1)
In contrast to the weakness in house price inflation and
housing activity, housing investment grew by 1.8% in Q1,
stronger than expected in May. Around a quarter of housing
investment is comprised of spending on services associated
with property transactions, while the remainder is formed of

new building and improvements to existing properties.
Growth in new housing starts has been robust, which will
support measured housing investment over time as those
homes are built. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that the
strength in starts has partly reflected strong demand for
new‑build properties from first‑time buyers using the Help to
Buy equity loan scheme, which offers government‑funded
equity loans of up to 20% of the purchase price of a
new‑build property.
Outlook for the housing market and impact on the
wider economy
Continued weak income growth in the near term is likely to
mean that price inflation and activity in the housing market
remain subdued over coming quarters. Set against that,
however, mortgage interest rates remain around record lows
(Table 2.B) and should continue to support housing demand,
although recent increases in market interest rates (Section 1)
are likely to push up mortgage rates a little in the near term.
Recent action by the Financial Policy Committee, by
promoting consistency across lenders in the tests they use to
assess mortgage affordability, should insure against the risk of
a loosening in underwriting standards.(1)
Annualised house price inflation is projected to pick up only
gradually, and mortgage approvals are projected to remain
broadly flat in the near term. That is weaker than expected in
May, in line with the net balances of responses to the
RICS survey, which point to smaller rises in house prices and
sales over the next twelve months than earlier in the year.
Housing market developments tend to be closely linked to
consumption growth, in large part because both tend to be
driven by common factors such as household confidence and
income expectations. To the extent that the near‑term
weakness in the housing market is being driven by weak
income growth, that is likely to be consistent with subdued
growth in household spending (Section 2.1). The weakness in
the housing market may also reduce spending growth directly,
by lowering the value of homeowners’ equity against which
they can borrow, although this effect is estimated to be
small.(2)
While weaker housing market activity will weigh on the pace
of housing investment growth, the recent strength in housing
starts is likely to support it in the near term. Housing
investment growth is projected to be relatively strong in the
second half of 2017, before falling back further ahead.

Section 3 Supply and the labour market 19
3 Supply and the labour market
Growth in companies’ demand for labour appears to have remained resilient in recent months, with
quarterly employment growth picking up in 2017 H1. Despite a further fall in unemployment, wage
growth remains subdued, probably in part due to continued weak productivity growth. Wage
growth is projected to remain modest in the near term, before recovering somewhat further ahead
reflecting underlying tightness in the labour market.
Output growth has slowed since last year (Section 2), but
labour demand growth has remained relatively resilient.
Annual growth in total hours worked is only slightly lower
than a year ago (Chart 3.1), with a rise in average hours
worked partially offsetting a decline in annual employment
growth. That resilience has been associated with a continued
tightening in labour market conditions (Section 3.1).
A key indicator of tightness in the labour market is the
unemployment rate. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5% in
the three months to May, and is expected to have fallen
slightly further to 4.4% in the three months to June
(Chart 3.2). That was lower than expected at the time of the
May Report and is broadly in line with the MPC’s estimate of
the equilibrium rate of unemployment, as set out in the box
on pages 18–20 of the February Report.
Changes in the degree of tightness in the labour market are
usually reflected in wage growth as they influence how much
companies need to pay to hold on to their employees or hire
new ones. Wage growth slowed, for example, as
unemployment increased during the financial crisis
(Chart 3.3). But wage growth has not picked up to past rates
as unemployment has declined, and has actually fallen back
since the end of 2016. Regular pay growth, which excludes
bonuses, is expected to have been only 2.2% in 2017 Q2
(Chart 3.4), although that was a little higher than expected in
May.(1)
As has been the case for several years, much of the continued
weakness in wage growth is likely to reflect subdued
productivity growth (Section 3.2). Over time, the pace of
wage growth is determined largely by productivity growth and
the price of domestic output, as that determines the revenue
available to companies to pay wages. While wage growth can
be volatile, it is also possible that other factors, such as

20 Inflation Report August 2017
uncertainty around the economic outlook and subdued wage
expectations, may be weighing on wage growth at present
(Section 3.3). The outlook for wages will depend, in part, on
the role of these factors and how persistent they prove to be.
Regular pay growth is projected to remain around its current
rate over the rest of this year, before picking up further ahead
as these factors wane and underlying tightness in the labour
market pushes up wage demands (Section 5).
3.1 Labour market developments
Employment and unemployment
Quarterly employment growth picked up sharply in 2017 Q1
and, while it is expected to have slowed in Q2 (Table 3.A), it
appears to be stronger than anticipated at the time of the
May Report. The pickup over 2017 so far has been more than
accounted for by an increase in the number of employees,
with the number of self-employed having fallen slightly.
While the data can be volatile, it is possible that companies
reduced hiring following the EU referendum, in anticipation of
a fall in demand, and subsequently began to make up the
shortfall in staff numbers in Q1 as demand proved somewhat
more resilient than expected. Nevertheless, over the past year
as a whole, employment growth has slowed from its more
rapid rates in previous years (Chart 3.1).
Indicators point to fairly solid employment growth in Q3. For
example, the number of vacancies relative to the size of the
labour force remained above its pre-crisis average in Q2, while
the rate of redundancies remained low (Table 3.B). Most
survey indicators of companies’ employment intentions are
also above their historical averages (Chart 3.5). Further
ahead, employment growth is expected to slow somewhat, as
output growth remains subdued.
Alongside the pickup in employment growth, the
unemployment rate continued to fall in the three months to
May, to 4.5%, and is expected to have fallen a little further
more recently (Chart 3.2). The fall to May was mainly driven
by a further decline in the short-term unemployment rate,
with long-term unemployment broadly unchanged at around
its past average rate (Table 3.B). Overall, the unemployment
rate is currently judged to be broadly in line with its
equilibrium rate. As set out in the February Report, however,
there remains significant uncertainty around that equilibrium
rate and there are a range of views among MPC members.
The further fall in unemployment is consistent with signs that
the labour market has tightened. Most survey indicators
suggest that recruitment difficulties increased during 2017 H1
and are above pre-crisis averages (Table 3.B). And contacts of
the Bank’s Agents report that the increase in recruitment
difficulties has been broad-based across a range of sectors.

Section 3 Supply and the labour market 21
The unemployment rate is expected to remain broadly stable
in coming months as employment growth moderates.
Hours worked
In addition to employment, labour demand growth can also be
met by increases in the number of hours people work. Average
hours worked are expected to have been broadly stable in
2017 Q2, somewhat higher than a year ago (Chart 3.6).
The extent to which changes in average hours worked affect
pay pressures will depend in part on how many hours those
staff want to work. According to the Labour Force Survey
(LFS), the net number of additional desired hours remains
higher than prior to the financial crisis (Table 3.B). And the
proportion of those working part-time who would prefer a
full-time job is still some way above its pre-crisis level, despite
falling in recent months as the proportion of the workforce in
full-time jobs has increased (Chart 3.7). That could suggest
that some scope remains for average hours to rise further
before pay pressures return to normal. In practice, however,
evidence suggests that people tend to be satisfied by smaller
increases in hours than they previously reported wanting.(1)
The loss in real income as a result of the depreciation in
sterling (Section 2) may also lead to some people wanting to
work longer hours to make up that loss. As discussed in the
box on pages 14–15, around 10% of respondents to the latest
household survey carried out for the Bank by NMG Consulting
in May reported that they would try to maintain their
spending to some degree in the face of a fall in their real
incomes by seeking more work. Perhaps consistent with that,
average hours worked have picked up in recent quarters,
relative to the number of hours people report they usually
work (Chart 3.6), as the amount of leave taken has fallen.
Despite the possibility of some households wanting to work
longer hours in response to the slowing in real income growth,
average hours worked are projected to fall back gradually in
coming quarters. That reflects the long-term structural effect
of an ageing workforce as older workers typically want to work
fewer hours.(2)
Participation and population growth
Changes in the proportion of the population participating in
the labour market — either working or looking for
employment — will also affect labour supply and therefore
labour market conditions. The participation rate is expected
to have fallen slightly in 2017 Q2 (Chart 3.8). Participation is
projected to remain broadly stable in the near term, reflecting
two large but broadly offsetting factors. The rising average
age of the population will tend to depress the aggregate

participation rate. Offsetting this, the participation rate
among older people has increased steadily in recent years and
is expected to continue to rise. In addition, in the near term, it
is also possible that weak real income growth could push up
participation if some of those not currently looking for a job
seek to supplement their household income by entering the
labour market.
Beyond changes in the participation rate, labour supply will be
determined in the long run mainly by population growth. In
the MPC’s projections, population growth is assumed to
evolve in line with the ONS’s latest projection, made in
October 2015. Under that projection, population growth
slows over the next three years, mainly as a result of lower net
immigration.
In 2016, net inward migration was around 248,000, or 0.4%
of the population. That is the lowest figure since the four
quarters to 2014 Q1, although it remains a little above the
ONS’s 2015 projection. Much of the fall, relative to a year
earlier, reflected a reduced net inflow from the rest of the
European Union. Some respondents to a survey by the Bank’s
Agents in May reported reduced availability of non-UK EU
labour over the past twelve months. That availability was
expected to contract further in the coming year.
Although changes in net inward migration will lead to changes
in labour supply, they will also affect domestic demand. In the
past, shifts in the path for net migration do not appear to have
had a significant direct impact on slack or wage growth.(1)
The prospects for net migration remain particularly uncertain
and will depend on a number of factors, including the
United Kingdom’s relative economic performance, the sterling
exchange rate and government policy.
3.2 Productivity
Four-quarter hourly productivity growth is expected to have
slowed slightly further in 2017 Q2 to 0.4% (Chart 3.9), and is
projected to remain broadly stable over the rest of the year.
Further ahead, productivity growth is projected to pick up
(Section 5). In particular, some of the recent weakness in
productivity growth is likely in part to reflect a degree of spare
capacity within firms, as output growth has slowed alongside
resilient employment growth. As that spare capacity is
absorbed, that is likely to push up productivity growth for a
period.
Overall, however, productivity growth is likely to remain
subdued. The low level of business investment (Section 2)
continues to lead to relatively slow growth in the capital stock
— the resources and equipment available to workers to
produce output — which will weigh on productivity growth.

Section 3 Supply and the labour market 23
The outlook for productivity will also be sensitive to how
companies anticipate and respond to the post-Brexit trading
arrangements between the United Kingdom and its economic
partners. The box on page 29 of the August 2016 Report set
out some of the long-term effects of changes in trading
arrangements on productivity growth. It remains difficult to
know the nature, scale and speed of companies’ adjustment,
both in anticipation of changes in future trading arrangements
and given the uncertainty around those arrangements. Those
uncertainties are likely to lead to lower investment in capital
equipment, research and skills than would otherwise be the
case, and so could weigh on overall productivity growth, for a
period at least (Section 5).
3.3 The outlook for wage growth
In the private sector, wage growth in the medium term will be
determined to a large extent by the revenue available to
companies to pay wages. This, in turn, will be determined by
productivity growth and the prices companies can achieve for
their output. Much of the weakness in wage growth in recent
years appears to reflect the persistent weakness in
productivity growth (Section 3.2). Cumulative growth of real
product wages — which adjusts wage growth for changes in
the prices of companies’ output — has been broadly in line
with that in productivity per head since the start of the crisis
(Chart 3.10).
Despite weak productivity growth, wage growth picked up
during 2014–16 as the labour market tightened and
unemployment fell (Chart 3.3). That was associated with a
recovery in the labour share of income (Chart 3.11). But wage
growth and the labour share have both fallen back somewhat
over the past year, even as unemployment has continued to
fall.
While wage growth can be volatile, the recent renewed
weakness suggests that factors other than productivity and
tightness in the labour market may be influencing pay
decisions. Uncertainty around the economic outlook may be
one such factor. It is possible that some households’ concerns
about the economic outlook in coming quarters have left
them reluctant to push for faster pay growth, even as
unemployment has fallen and inflation has risen. For example,
household wage expectations, according to the Bank of
England/TNS quarterly survey, were broadly unchanged in
2017 Q1, relative to a year ago, despite a pickup in inflation
expectations (Section 4). Uncertainty about the economic
outlook may also affect companies’ willingness to raise pay at
a faster pace until they have more clarity about future
demand. The Bank’s Agents report that, for some companies,
such uncertainty has been one factor influencing their pay
decisions.

24 Inflation Report August 2017
Regular pay growth is projected to remain subdued over the
rest of 2017 at around its current rate (Table 3.C). Consistent
with that, most survey indicators of pay growth remain below
past averages (Table 3.D). Further out, pay growth is
projected to pick up, as any temporary factors currently
weighing on wage growth dissipate, and the past tightening in
the labour market starts to push up wage demands more
widely. Overall, wage growth is likely to remain below its
pre-crisis average rate, however, largely reflecting continued
subdued productivity growth (Section 5).

4 Costs and prices
Although CPI inflation has been volatile, it has risen over 2017 and was 2.6% in June. It is expected
to remain around 2¾% in the near term, boosted by higher import prices as a result of the
depreciation in sterling, before easing back towards the 2% target during 2018. Growth in firms’
imported costs appears to have started moderating. Domestically generated inflation appears to
have remained relatively subdued and inflation expectations remain consistent with the MPC’s
2% target.
4.1 Consumer price developments and the
near-term outlook
CPI inflation was 2.6% in June, having picked up from 2.3% in
March. This outturn was in line with the projection at the time
of the May Report (Chart 4.1), although inflation has been
volatile in recent months. In particular, shifts in the timing of
discounting have led to swings in clothing and footwear price
inflation.
Sterling depreciated sharply following the EU referendum and
has remained 15%–20% lower than its November 2015 peak
since then. As a result, firms’ imported costs have risen
sharply since mid-2016 (Chart 4.2) leading to upward pressure
on many retail prices (Section 4.2). The speed at which firms
pass movements in sterling through to consumer prices varies
across products. Fuel prices responded to the depreciation
quite quickly and over recent months the effect of higher
import prices has become more widespread across CPI
components (Chart 4.3). Reflecting this, margins on
consumer goods and services are estimated to have recovered
somewhat, having been squeezed by rising imported costs in
2016 H2 (Chart 4.4).
As well as firms’ external costs, the path for inflation will
depend on developments in domestically generated inflation
(DGI) (Section 4.3). DGI will reflect developments in domestic
labour costs (Chart 4.2), as well as firms’ margins. These can
be influenced by companies’ and households’ inflation
expectations.
CPI inflation is projected to remain around 2¾% in coming
months (Chart 4.1). The boost from the 2016 pickup in fuel
prices has started to drop out of the annual comparison, which
will drag on inflation, while higher import prices continue to
push it up. Inflation is expected to start to fall back towards
the 2% target during 2018, primarily reflecting past increases
in energy prices falling out of the annual comparison.

4.2 Imported cost pressures
The cost of imports is a key part of the cost of producing
UK goods and services. Those import prices will reflect both
the foreign currency export prices charged by firms selling to
the United Kingdom and the sterling exchange rate. The
depreciation in sterling has pushed up import prices since late
2015. The impact on CPI inflation will depend on the timing of
and extent to which companies: absorb those higher import
costs in their margins; can limit growth in other costs such as
wages; or choose to raise their prices.
Energy prices
As oil is highly tradable its price is set in global markets. The
cost of oil makes up around a third of the cost of retail fuel
and changes in oil prices tend to be passed through to
consumer prices much more quickly than changes in other
import prices. In sterling terms, oil prices have fallen by 10%
since the May Report (Chart 4.5) mainly reflecting a fall in
US dollar oil prices (Section 1). Despite this, sterling oil prices
remain slightly higher than a year ago. Fuel prices are
therefore expected to continue to make a small positive
contribution to inflation in the near term (Chart 4.3), though
less than projected in May. The oil futures curve, on which the
MPC’s forecasts are conditioned, slopes slightly upwards,
which implies a gradual rise in petrol prices over the next
few years.
Sterling wholesale gas prices have also fallen but broadly in
line with the futures curve on which the MPC’s May forecasts
were conditioned (Chart 4.5), and the futures curve has
changed little since then. The major retail energy providers
have announced increases in their electricity and gas prices in
recent months, reflecting rising costs associated with
structural changes, such as the increased use of renewable
energy sources. Electricity and gas prices have pushed up
inflation since March and their contribution is expected to
increase slightly further in Q3 (Chart 4.3).
Non-energy import prices
Sterling has depreciated by 18% since its November 2015
peak, including by 2% since the May Report (Section 1). That
depreciation will push up a range of consumer prices over
time. As explained in the box on pages 28–29 of the
November 2015 Report, Bank staff have estimated that, on
average, 60% of changes in the sterling value of world export
prices tend to be reflected in UK import prices. That
pass-through is usually completed within a year. Those
changes in import prices are judged to affect CPI inflation over
a longer period, broadly in line with the import share of CPI,
which is around a third.
While import price data can be subject to large revisions, they
currently suggest that the pass-through of the recent
depreciation to import prices has, to date, been more limited

than on average in the past. Sterling non-energy import prices
rose by 8% between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q1 (Chart 4.6). This
represents only around 40%, rather than 60%, of the change
in sterling world export prices over that period.
Despite that more limited rise in import prices, CPI inflation
appears to have picked up by around its average response to
the depreciation in sterling. Inflation among import-intensive
components of CPI — those components that are imported or
have a high share of imported inputs, such as food — has
picked up sharply and remains relatively elevated (Chart 4.7).
The pickup in CPI inflation could suggest that import prices
have actually risen by more than suggested by the official
data. The rise in import prices has, however, been in line with
a range of indicators of imported input costs and those
measures eased back in 2017 Q2 (Chart 4.6).
It is possible that the speed of pass-through to CPI inflation
from import prices has been faster or that pass-through, in
particular to domestically produced tradable goods and
services prices, has been greater than on average. This would
suggest that although imported input costs have squeezed
domestic firms’ margins, these have recovered more quickly
than in the past. While exporters’ margins will have been
boosted by the depreciation in sterling, Bank staff estimate
that margins on consumer goods and services were squeezed
somewhat in 2016 H2 (Chart 4.4). The current import price
data suggest margins recovered slightly in 2017 Q1, and
probably recovered further in Q2.
A range of indicators suggest that companies’ output price
inflation is likely to moderate somewhat in coming months
(Chart 4.7). That is likely to reduce the extent of inflationary
pressure along supply chains but will take time to be passed
through to retail prices. As such, while CPI inflation is
expected to start to ease back towards the 2% target during
2018, the pass-through of past imported cost pressures is
expected to continue to boost inflation for some time
(Section 5).
4.3 Underlying inflationary pressure
Domestically generated inflation
Alongside external costs, the rate of CPI inflation reflects
domestically generated inflation (DGI). DGI, which reflects
developments in domestic costs as well as domestic profit
margins, will determine where CPI inflation settles once
transitory effects, such as from the recent fall in sterling, have
passed through. As discussed in the box on page 28 of the
May Report, while it is not directly observable, there are a
number of measures that are closely linked to the concept
of DGI.

28 Inflation Report August 2017
Measures of core inflation, which exclude volatile
CPI components such as food and energy, are sometimes used
as measures of DGI. Core inflation, however, can still be
significantly affected by external cost pressures, as many
goods and some services prices are sensitive to changes in
import prices. Indeed, measures of core inflation have picked
up since mid-2016, as the effect of the depreciation in sterling
has been reflected across a range of goods prices. Even if
particularly import-intensive CPI components are excluded, it
is difficult to remove the impact of external cost pressures
entirely.
Measures of inflation in the services sector are often also used
as indicators of DGI, as most services are produced
domestically. Two key measures used are wholesale services
prices — as measured by the services producer price index
(PPI) — and the price of consumer services excluding
components that are more likely to be related to tradable
prices or government policy, such as airfares and education.
These measures of services price inflation have been relatively
stable (Chart 4.8). However, while services prices are
informative about trends in DGI, they exclude the
domestically produced element of goods. More broadly, as
with core CPI, services prices will also be affected by external
cost pressures to some degree; for example, many service
providers will use imported goods as an input. And PPI will
also include the prices of services provided to exporters and
importers.
At face value, measures of the price of domestic production
appear to capture the concept of DGI most closely. The GVA
deflator is a measure of the price of domestic production, from
which the government sector can be excluded to capture the
price of private domestic production better. However, these
deflator-based measures are also affected by import and
export prices. Over the past year, rises in export prices relative
to import prices have pushed up the GVA deflator. These
deflator-based measures are, therefore, likely to overstate the
extent of domestic inflationary pressure at present.
As the main domestic input into production, the cost of labour
is a key determinant of DGI. The degree to which growth in
labour costs per worker, such as wages and non-wage benefits,
affect inflation will depend on how these costs evolve relative
to growth in the output produced per worker — known as unit
labour cost (ULC) growth. While ULC growth is less likely than
other DGI indicators to be affected by external factors, it does
not capture changes in firms’ margins. Moreover, ULC growth
can be quite volatile.
Four-quarter ULC growth remained below its historical
average rate at around 2% in 2017 Q1, as the weakness in
wage growth coincided with modest productivity growth
(Chart 4.9). And four-quarter ULC growth is expected to have
slowed sharply in Q2, reflecting a marked slowing in non-wage

Section 4 Costs and prices 29
labour cost growth. Non-wage labour costs had been boosted
in April 2016 by a rise in employers’ National Insurance
contributions and these will have dropped out of the annual
comparison in 2017 Q2. ULC growth is expected to pick back
up as wage growth starts to rise (Section 3) and as employers’
auto-enrolment pension contribution rates increase in
2018 Q2, raising non-wage labour costs.
In addition to labour costs, developments in firms’ margins are
a key determinant of DGI. On the one hand, evidence of a
recent recovery in margins on consumer goods and services
(Section 4.2 and Chart 4.4) could suggest that domestic
inflationary pressure is increasing, as firms feel able to raise
their prices. Moreover, margins tend to be cyclical, falling
when spare capacity opens up and then rising as capacity
pressures build, and so are likely to rise further (Section 5).(1)
On the other hand, if the increase in margins has occurred in
anticipation of further rises in import prices, then margins
could fall back as that growth in imported costs comes
through.
Overall, indicators of DGI suggest that domestic inflationary
pressure is likely to have remained somewhat subdued in
recent quarters (Chart 4.8). The rises in deflator-based
measures of DGI have largely reflected the rise in export prices
in response to the depreciation in sterling, rather than a
marked strengthening in domestic prices. And while the
slowing in ULC growth is expected to be temporary, it is
expected to remain below rates consistent with inflation at
target in the near term, before recovering further ahead
(Section 5). There are, however, a range of views among
MPC members about the relative importance of various
measures of DGI.
Inflation expectations
Inflation expectations can also affect the outlook for inflation,
such as through wage and price-setting behaviour. The MPC
monitors a range of indicators to assess whether inflation
expectations remain consistent with its 2% target.
Movements in measures of companies’ inflation expectations
have been mixed since May. Expectations for CPI inflation in
two years’ time among respondents to the Deloitte CFO
Survey rose slightly further in Q2 (Chart 4.10), with the
median expectation rising from 2.4% in Q1 to 2.6%. In
contrast, the CBI measure of respondents’ expected inflation
within their own sector fell back somewhat in Q2, following a
sharp rise in Q1 (Table 4.B).
Most other indicators of inflation expectations have changed
little since May (Table 4.B). Short-term and long-term
household inflation expectations have, on average, remained

around past average levels and so appear to be consistent with
CPI inflation returning towards the target. Similarly, financial
market measures of inflation compensation suggest market
participants’ expectations have changed little since May at
both short and long-term horizons, and long-run expectations
remain close to past averages.
Overall, the MPC judges that inflation expectations remain
well anchored, and that indicators of medium-term inflation
expectations continue to be broadly consistent with the 2%
target. The MPC will continue to monitor measures of
inflation expectations closely.

5 Prospects for inflation
CPI inflation has remained above the 2% target as rises in import prices following the steep fall in
the sterling exchange rate last year continue to pass through to consumer prices. That has weighed
on households’ real incomes and consumption, contributing to the slowdown in GDP growth in
the first half of 2017. Over the forecast period, growth in real income and consumption is projected
to remain subdued. The effect of that on overall GDP growth is offset to some extent by
UK exports and investment, which are supported by strong growth in the rest of the world and
the lower exchange rate. Overall, given a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises by around
½ percentage point over the next three years, growth is projected to be modest and unemployment
to stay close to its current rate. Import price pressures begin to fade in the second half of the
forecast period, but are still keeping inflation above the 2% target at the end. On the market path
for Bank Rate, the small degree of slack remaining in the economy is absorbed and domestic
inflationary pressures are judged likely to increase over the forecast period.
CPI inflation was 2.6% in June, as projected three months
ago, as higher import prices continued to feed through the
supply chain. Wage growth has remained subdued.
Following the strong outturns immediately after the
EU referendum, UK GDP growth fell back in the first half of
2017. Growth is expected to remain at 0.3% in Q3 before
picking up slightly at the end of the year. Over 2017 as a
whole, growth is projected to be a little weaker than
anticipated in May, reflecting a less marked pickup in business
investment (Section 2).
In contrast, global growth has remained strong. In particular,
euro-area activity indicators point to faster growth in the near
term than projected in May. That strength has been reflected
in financial asset prices. The euro has risen against both
sterling and the US dollar over the past three months.
Longer-term interest rates have risen in many advanced
economies, as have implied paths for policy rates over shorter
horizons.
In the United Kingdom, financial market prices now imply a
rise in Bank Rate in 2018 Q3, compared with 2019 Q4 at the
time of the May Report. The projections in this Report are
conditioned on a path for Bank Rate nearly ¼ percentage
point higher than that in the May Report (Table 5.A). The
interest rates faced by households and companies also depend
on the spreads banks charge over market interest rates. Since
May, these spreads have fallen slightly but the effect of that is
projected to be offset over the forecast period by the impact

of the Financial Policy Committee’s decision to raise the
countercyclical capital buffer.(1)
The sterling ERI has fallen by 2% since May and is currently
18% below its late-2015 peak. The decline in sterling
since late 2015 largely reflects financial market
participants’ judgements about the impact of Brexit on the
United Kingdom. Those judgements depend on assumptions
about the United Kingdom’s trading relationships after Brexit
and about the transition to those arrangements. As in
previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on
the average of a range of possible outcomes for the
United Kingdom’s trading relationship with the European
Union. They also assume that households and companies
base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth
adjustment to those new trading arrangements.
The projections in this Report are very similar to those made
three months ago (Table 5.B). Inflation begins the projection
well above the 2% target. It is expected to remain around
2¾% until early next year (Chart 5.1), with some monthly
volatility around that path, such that it is projected to peak at
around 3% in October. That overshoot reflects upward
pressure from the prices of tradable goods and services, which
begins to ease in the second half of the forecast period
(Key Judgement 1). Domestic inflationary pressures, and in
particular wage growth, have largely remained subdued even
as unemployment has fallen towards the MPC’s central
(1) Unless otherwise stated, the projections shown in this section are conditioned on:
Bank Rate following a path implied by market yields; the stock of purchased gilts
remaining at £435 billion and the stock of purchased corporate bonds remaining at
£10 billion throughout the forecast period and the Term Funding Scheme (TFS), all
three of which are financed by the issuance of central bank reserves; the
Recommendations and Directions of the Financial Policy Committee and the current
regulatory plans of the Prudential Regulation Authority; the Government’s tax and
spending plans as set out in the 2017 March Budget; commodity prices following
market paths; and the sterling exchange rate remaining broadly flat. The main
assumptions are set out in a table at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/

Chart 5.1 CPI inflation projection based on market
interest rate expectations, other policy measures as
announced
Charts 5.1 and 5.2 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future. They have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b). If economic circumstances identical to today’s
were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan charts are constructed
so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the
fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey
background. See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

estimate of its equilibrium rate. Although labour market slack
has diminished, there is judged to be some spare capacity
within companies, although estimates of this are uncertain.
Over the forecast period, slack in the economy is absorbed
gradually and wage and domestic price pressures increase.
Those increasing pressures mean that CPI inflation stabilises
towards the end of the forecast period, even as imported
pressures are falling away (Key Judgement 2). Conditioned on
market yields, inflation is projected to be a little above the
target at the end of the forecast period, although the
overshoot can entirely be accounted for by the impact of
higher import prices. The effects on inflation of the slightly
higher path for Bank Rate than in May are offset by greater
upward pressure from the lower exchange rate, so the inflation
profile is very similar to that three months ago (Chart 5.2).
The projections for wages and import prices imply continued
weakness in households’ real income growth over the forecast
period. Consumption growth is therefore projected to remain
subdued, weighing on GDP growth (Key Judgement 3). Acting
against that to some extent, global growth remains strong and
the lower exchange rate supports net trade. That helps to
support UK investment by firms in the tradable sector over the
forecast period, partly offsetting continued uncertainty around
the effects of Brexit (Key Judgement 4). The growth
projection therefore embodies a rotation towards net trade
and investment and away from consumption. Overall,
UK activity picks up from current rates to grow at a modest
pace throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.3). Growth is
slightly weaker than projected in May in the near term but
similar further out.
At its meeting ending on 2 August 2017, the MPC voted to
maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%, to maintain the stock of sterling
non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at
£10 billion, to maintain the stock of UK government bond
purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves,
at £435 billion and to close the drawdown period for the Term
Funding Scheme on 28 February 2018, as envisaged when the
scheme was introduced. The factors behind that decision are
set out in the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this
Report, and in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.(1)
The remainder of this section sets out the MPC’s projections,
and the risks around them, in more detail.

ONS data
Chart 5.3 GDP projection based on market interest rate
expectations, other policy measures as announced
The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b). To the left of the vertical dashed line,
the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past; to the right, it
reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future. If economic circumstances
identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that
the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of
those occasions. The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within
each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast
period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of
100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere
outside the green area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the
light grey background. See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a
fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.
34 Inflation Report August 2017
inflation projection. The sterling ERI has fallen a further 2%
since the May Report, to 18% below its late-2015 peak. That is
feeding through to non-energy import prices, which have risen
by around 8% over the past year or so (Section 4). That rise is
smaller than initially expected, suggesting a degree of
catch-up to come. Combined with the depreciation since May,
that results in a projected further rise of 4% in aggregate
import prices (Chart 5.4).
With higher import prices feeding through to consumer prices
only gradually, consumer-facing companies’ profit margins
were squeezed by higher costs during 2016 (Section 4). Some
of that squeeze has unwound in recent quarters as companies
have begun to raise prices in response. Those price rises mean
that the contribution of import prices to inflation is estimated
to have picked up to around ¾ percentage point. That
contribution is expected to rise slightly further in coming
quarters, before beginning to fall back. This is consistent with
the MPC’s assumption that import prices will pass through to
CPI inflation slightly faster than in previous episodes. Even
under that assumption, import prices are still adding around
¼ percentage point to inflation at the end of the forecast
period.
Key Judgement 2: as the remaining slack in the economy is
absorbed, domestic price pressures gradually increase
Labour costs are a key component of domestic inflationary
pressures. Wage growth has remained subdued in recent years
even as unemployment has fallen (Section 3). That, in large
part, reflects lacklustre productivity growth and a degree of
slack in the labour market. As in previous Reports, the MPC
expects underlying productivity growth to remain well below
its pre-crisis average rate over the forecast period. That is
partly because growth in the capital stock has slowed,
following a period of weak investment, weighing on
productivity growth. Productivity is also likely to be
influenced by companies’ expectations about, and
preparations for, Brexit. For example, if trading arrangements
are expected to be less open for a period, the resultant need
for some companies to reorient their business models is likely
to weigh a little on productivity growth. Overall, weak
productivity growth is expected to reduce wage growth
relative to rates seen prior to the financial crisis.
Although subdued productivity growth and a margin of slack
can account for much of the post-crisis trend in wage growth,
most recently four-quarter wage growth has ticked down even
as the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5%, its assumed
equilibrium. It is possible that this weakening simply reflects
volatility in the data. It might also reflect some employers
being less willing to commit to higher basic pay levels until
they have more certainty over future demand for their output
or the path of non-labour costs, including imports. Over the
forecast period, whatever additional factors have held wage
growth down beyond subdued productivity growth are

9 Unemployment rate, per cent
Chart 5.5 Unemployment projection based on market
interest rate expectations, other policy measures as
announced
The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b). The coloured bands have the same
interpretation as in Chart 5.1, and portray 90% of the probability distribution. The calibration of
this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example,
it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on
unemployment in successive quarters. The fan begins in 2017 Q2, a quarter earlier than the fan
for CPI inflation. That is because Q2 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in
part on data for April and May. The unemployment rate was 4.5% in the three months to May,
and is projected to be 4.4% in Q2 as a whole. A significant proportion of this distribution lies
below Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment rate. There is
therefore uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart.

assumed to dissipate to an extent. With the unemployment
rate remaining close to 4.5% (Chart 5.5), wage growth
therefore picks up (Table 5.C). That is reflected in a recovery
in unit labour cost growth (Chart 5.6), which adjusts wages,
plus other employment costs such as pension contributions,
for productivity.
Although unemployment points to little slack, the period of
sluggish GDP growth in the first half of 2017 suggests a
continuing degree of spare capacity in the economy. With
continued weakness in underlying productivity growth, the
modest pace of GDP growth over the forecast period is
sufficient to absorb that margin of slack. That would be
consistent with a modest, cyclical, recovery in consumer
sector companies’ profit margins over the forecast period.
Overall, domestic inflationary pressures increase gradually
over the forecast period as in May. Within that, however,
the projections for wage and unit labour cost growth are
lower than those in the MPC’s May forecast. The impact of
lower unit cost growth on inflation is offset by a slightly
larger rebuild in profit margins for consumer sector firms. In
May, the projections incorporated a relatively large rise in
the labour share — households’ labour income as a proportion
of UK income — as real wages were assumed to rise
significantly faster than productivity. The Committee has
reassessed that judgement and reduced the extent of that rise.
The counterpart to this is a slightly higher path for the profit
share.
The paths for slack and domestic inflationary pressures mean
that, as in May, there is a risk that CPI inflation remains
somewhat above the target even once the boost from import
prices has dissipated. That could come about if the period of
above-target inflation feeds through to higher inflation
expectations and, in turn, wage and price-setting behaviour.
To date, medium-term measures of inflation expectations
have remained well anchored. In the other direction, there is a
risk that domestic pressures do not increase as much as
expected. That could come about if the factors that have
restrained wage growth recently turn out to be more
persistent. Additionally, consumer sector companies may not
expand profit margins as much as incorporated in the central
projection. The Committee will monitor both these risks
closely over the coming quarters.
Key Judgement 3: consumption grows at a subdued pace,
broadly in line with households’ real incomes
Subdued wage growth together with the impact of the lower
pound mean that real wages have fallen over the past year.
That has started to feed through to households’ spending
decisions, with quarterly consumption growth slowing to 0.4%
in 2017 Q1 and signs of further weakness in the housing
market.

36 Inflation Report August 2017
With a moderate recovery in wage growth and inflation falling
back, the MPC projects real wage growth to pick up over the
forecast period. It nevertheless remains subdued.
Correspondingly, household consumption grows at less than
¼% per quarter during the first half of the forecast period and
picks up only a little later on (Table 5.C). The profile further
out is a little lower than in May, reflecting the weaker
projection for wage growth and the effects on real income of
the further fall in the exchange rate, together with the slightly
higher yield curve (Key Judgements 1 and 2). The saving ratio
is projected to be broadly flat (Table 5.D), once volatility
stemming from unusually large tax payments (on forestalled
dividend income) in 2017 Q1 passes (Section 2).(1) In the
central projection, consumer credit growth slows a little next
year from current high rates.
It is possible that there could be a little more momentum in
consumption in the near term than assumed. Despite a
marked fall in June, consumer confidence is close to its
long-run average rate and retail sales rose in Q2, following a
decline in Q1. Households could increase spending at a faster
rate than income for a while, by reducing the amount saved or
by borrowing more than assumed. Over time, however,
households will need to adjust spending towards the lower
level of real income consistent with the decline in the
exchange rate and the factors that underlie that decline.
It is also possible that consumption could adjust more sharply
and the saving ratio could rise. Over the past three months,
the housing market has weakened further, with quarterly
house price inflation now around zero and transactions
remaining low (see the box on pages 17–18). That could
suggest that households have become more pessimistic about
their wage growth or job prospects, which would also be
expected to weigh on their consumption decisions. Over the
forecast period, house price inflation picks up gradually
(Table 5.E), but the level of house prices remains a little lower
than projected three months ago. The weaker outlook for the
housing market is likely, over time, to feed through to slower
growth in housing investment (Table 5.C), after some support
in the near term from the recent strength in housing starts.
Given these judgements, household consumption is projected
to continue to provide less support to growth throughout the
forecast period than in the past couple of years. The overall
growth forecast therefore depends on how much demand
rotates towards net trade and business investment.
Key Judgement 4: global growth remains strong, supporting
UK net trade and investment in the face of continued
uncertainty around Brexit
Since the beginning of 2017, the MPC has revised up its
projection for global growth following indications of greater
momentum in the advanced economies. Data since May have

provided little further news on global growth (Section 1). In
the euro area, activity indicators point to faster growth in the
near term than projected in May (Table 5.D). Acting in the
other direction, the projection for US growth is slightly
weaker. That reflects a smaller expected boost from fiscal
policy than previously assumed.
In the emerging economies, the outlook for growth in China
has been revised up a little following continued strong
outturns. Growth is nonetheless expected to slow a little over
the next three years towards 6%. That projection remains
consistent with rapid credit growth, and significant risks to
financial stability remain.
Global activity is projected to expand at around 3½% per year
based on PPP weights (Table 5.D). Based on UK trade shares,
which are skewed more heavily towards the advanced
economies, growth is 2½% (Chart 5.7). Both projections
Table 5.E Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements
The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key
judgements. Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will
monitor a broad range of variables to assess the degree to
which the risks are crystallising. The table below shows
Bank staff’s indicative near-term projections that are
consistent with the judgements in the MPC’s central view
evolving as expected.
Key judgement Likely developments in 2017 Q3 to 2018 Q1 if judgements evolve as expected
1: significant upward
pressure on inflation
from import prices eases
only in the second half
of the forecast period
•	 Non-fuel import prices to rise by 2¾% in the year to 2018 Q1.
•	 Electricity and gas price rises to contribute slightly less than ¼ percentage point to CPI inflation.
•	 Indicators of medium-term inflation expectations to continue to be broadly consistent with the 2% target.
•	 Commodity prices and sterling ERI to evolve in line with the conditioning assumptions set out in
www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2017/augca.pdf.
2: as the remaining slack
in the economy is
absorbed, domestic price
pressures gradually
increase
•	 Unemployment rate to remain around its current level of 4½%.
•	 Participation rate to remain around its current level of 63½%.
•	 Average weekly hours worked to fall to around 32.
•	 Quarterly hourly labour productivity growth to average just under ½%.
•	 Four-quarter growth in AWE regular pay to be around 2¼% in 2017 H2.
•	 Four-quarter growth in whole-economy unit labour costs to fall to around ¾% in Q3 before recovering
towards 1½%.
3: consumption grows at
a subdued pace, broadly
in line with households’
real incomes
•	 Real post-tax household income to be broadly flat.
•	 Quarterly consumption growth to average ¼%.
•	 Credit spreads to be broadly flat.
•	 Mortgage approvals for house purchase to average around 66,000 per month.
•	 The average of the Halifax/Markit and Nationwide house price indices to increase by a little less than
½% per quarter, on average.
•	 Quarterly housing investment growth to average 1%.
4: global growth
remains strong,
supporting UK net trade
and investment in the
face of continued
uncertainty around
Brexit
•	 Quarterly euro-area growth to average a little above ½%.
•	 Annual euro-area HICP inflation to fall back to around 1%.
•	 Quarterly US GDP growth to average ½%.
•	 Annual US PCE inflation to remain below 2%.
•	 Indicators of activity consistent with four-quarter PPP-weighted emerging market economy growth of
around 4¾%; within that, GDP growth in China to average around 6¾%.
•	 Net trade to provide a small boost to quarterly UK GDP growth.
•	 The UK current account deficit to narrow to around 3% of GDP.
•	 Quarterly growth in UK business investment to average ½%.

imply faster growth over the forecast period than the average
of the past five years, but the risks to those projections remain
skewed to the downside.
The world outlook is therefore supportive for UK exporters.
Many are also benefiting from the lower level of the sterling
exchange rate, which increases the profitability of exporting.
The projection incorporates some effect from the prospect of
Brexit weighing on exports as companies here and abroad
begin to adjust trading relationships before the
United Kingdom leaves the European Union. That also weighs
on import flows, which are further dampened by the higher
cost of imports. Overall, net trade supports growth over the
forecast period.
The stronger global outlook, together with increased
incentives for exporters to expand or renew export capacity to
take advantage of the lower pound, also supports UK
investment over the forecast period. One feature of growth
over this year has been a recovery in investment spending in
the United States and euro area. That has been seen to a
lesser degree in UK business investment data and intentions
surveys. There is evidence that global factors have played an
important role in UK investment in the past and the world
forecast implies that they are likely to support investment
here for much of the forecast period too.
Investment decisions also depend on domestic influences,
which are, on balance, judged to pull down investment growth
over the forecast period. At face value, conditions for
investment are supportive at the moment — the return on
capital is high, the cost of capital is low and spare capacity is
limited. But the anticipation of Brexit and related
uncertainties are likely to weigh on companies’ investment
plans, even assuming that those plans are based on the
expectation of a smooth transition to any new trading
arrangements. So investment grows at a solid pace over the
forecast period (Table 5.C), but it is not as strong as would
have been expected given global and financial conditions
alone. Investment is a little weaker than in the May Report in
the near term, consistent with the tick down in some survey
indicators, but much of that weakness is unwound over the
forecast period.
Together, the outlook for net trade and investment act to
support GDP growth during the period of subdued
consumption growth. Even so, UK activity only grows at a
modest pace over the forecast period.

5.2 The projections for demand,
unemployment and inflation
With recent outturns pointing to sluggish activity, the MPC
projects four-quarter growth to slow further in the near term,
a weaker path than in May. That does not alter the

Chart 5.9 Inflation probabilities relative to the target
The August and May swathes in this chart are derived from the same distributions as Charts 5.1
and 5.2 respectively. They indicate the assessed probability of inflation relative to the target in
each quarter of the forecast period. The 5 percentage points width of the swathes reflects the
fact that there is uncertainty about the precise probability in any given quarter, but they should
not be interpreted as confidence intervals.
Section 5 Prospects for inflation 39
Committee’s view on growth in the medium term. Based on
the judgements above and the risks around them, and under
the path for Bank Rate based on market yields and an
unchanged stock of purchased assets, the MPC projects
four-quarter growth to pick up over 2018, settling at around
1¾% thereafter, as in the May projection (Chart 5.8).
Within that, consumption growth remains subdued as
households continue to adjust to a period of weak real income
growth. But with strong global growth, support comes from
net trade and a pickup in business investment growth. That
outlook is consistent with expectations, on the part of
households and businesses, of a smooth transition to
post-Brexit trading arrangements. The risks to the projection
remain skewed to the downside further out (Table 5.F),
stemming from the global outlook. Although UK growth
remains modest, it is close to or a little above trend, such that
a small output gap at the start of the forecast closes by the
end.
Overall, CPI inflation is projected to remain around its current
rate for the next few quarters before gradually falling back.
Conditional on the market path for Bank Rate, inflation is
judged more likely to remain above the 2% target than fall
below it throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.9), reflecting
continued gradual pass-through of higher import prices. The
¼ percentage point overshoot of the target at the end of the
forecast period is entirely accounted for by the effect of higher
import prices. That said, domestic pressures are increasing at
that point as the degree of spare capacity closes. The profile,
which is conditioned on a higher path for Bank Rate and a
lower exchange rate, is very similar to that in the May Report
(Table 5.G). The risks around the central projection for
inflation remain balanced (Chart 5.10).
Charts 5.11 and 5.12 show the MPC’s projections under the
alternative constant Bank Rate assumption, and an unchanged
stock of purchased assets. That assumption is that Bank Rate
remains at 0.25% throughout the three years of the forecast
period, before rising towards the market path over the
subsequent three years. Under that path, GDP growth is a
little stronger and inflation stabilises at a slightly higher rate.

Other forecasters’ expectations
This box reports the results of the Bank’s most recent survey
of external forecasters, carried out in July.(1) As in May,
respondents expected four-quarter GDP growth to slow over
the coming year, before picking up to just under 2% three
years ahead (Table 1). Forecasters were, however, on average
attaching less weight to higher growth in coming years than
they were three months earlier. At the two-year horizon, the
average weight on growth of 2% or more declined from
around a third to just under a quarter (Chart A).
External forecasters’ central expectations for CPI inflation at
all horizons have, on average, fallen since the May Report
(Chart B). Respondents to the most recent survey expected
inflation to fall back to 2% by 2020 Q3, on average.
External forecasters’ expectations for Bank Rate have, on
average, risen by around 0.2 percentage points at the two and
three-year horizon relative to May, to 0.7% and 1.0%
respectively (Table 1). Respondents now place an average of
just over 60% weight on Bank Rate being 0.5% or greater in
two years’ time, compared to a weight of around 45% three
months ago (Chart C). As in May, almost all forecasters
expected the current stocks of gilt and corporate bond
purchases to remain unchanged over the next three years.
