Inflation Report
May 2017

In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.
Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy,
including its objectives for growth and employment.
The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of
the Monetary Policy Committee. It serves two purposes. First, its preparation provides a
comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid
to our decision-making. Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the
reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect.
Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are
based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths
for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central
projections.
This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with
section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Monetary Policy Summary i
Monetary Policy Summary
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the
2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its
meeting ending on 10 May 2017, the Committee voted by a majority of 7–1 to maintain
Bank Rate at 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling
non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of
central bank reserves, at £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the
stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at
£435 billion.
As the MPC observed at the time of the United Kingdom’s referendum on EU membership, the appropriate path for
monetary policy depends on the evolution of demand, potential supply, the exchange rate, and therefore inflation.
Aggregate demand slowed markedly in 2017 Q1, and the MPC’s central projection contained in the May Inflation Report is
now for quarterly growth to remain around current rates, and close to trend. The slowdown appears to be concentrated
in consumer-facing sectors, partly reflecting the impact of sterling’s past depreciation on household income and
spending. The Committee judges that consumption growth will be slower in the near term than previously anticipated
before recovering in the latter part of the forecast period as real income picks up.
In the MPC’s central forecast, weaker consumption this year is largely balanced by rising net trade and investment. The
outlook for global activity continues to improve. Business surveys and Bank Agents’ reports imply that business
investment growth is likely to be higher in 2017 than previously projected. The stronger global outlook and the level of
sterling are providing incentives for many exporters to renew and increase capacity.
Sterling appreciated by 2.5% between the February and May Inflation Reports, although it remained 16% below its
November 2015 peak. Over the same time period, shorter-term UK interest rates fell, with the sterling yield curve used
to condition the forecast close to its lowest level since the start of the year.
CPI inflation has risen above the MPC’s 2% target as the depreciation of sterling has begun to feed through to consumer
prices. This impact has been offset to some extent by continued subdued growth in domestic costs. In particular, wage
growth has been notably weaker than expected. The MPC expects inflation to rise further above the target in the coming
months, peaking a little below 3% in the fourth quarter. Conditioned on the market yield curve underlying the
May projections, inflation is forecast to remain above the MPC’s target throughout the forecast period. The projected
overshoot entirely reflects the effects of the falls in sterling since late November 2015 on import prices. This effect is
expected to diminish towards the end of the forecast period. With unemployment falling to its estimated equilibrium
rate, however, wage growth is expected to recover significantly, and the drag from domestic costs to lessen, over the
same period.
Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new
international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over
the next few years. Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the
cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth. For this reason, the MPC’s remit
specifies that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which
it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity.
ii Inflation Report May 2017
In the MPC’s latest projections there is such a trade-off through most of the forecast period, with a degree of spare
capacity and inflation remaining above the 2% target. In the final year of the forecast, however, the output gap closes
and inflation rises slightly further above the target. This is conditioned on the assumptions that the adjustment to the
United Kingdom’s new relationship with the European Union is smooth, and that Bank Rate follows the market-implied
path for interest rates. At its May meeting, seven members thought that the current monetary policy setting remained
appropriate to balance the demands of the Committee’s remit. Kristin Forbes considered it appropriate to increase
Bank Rate by 25 basis points.
As the Committee has previously noted, there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.
The continuing suitability of the current policy stance depends on the trade-off between above-target inflation and slack
in the economy, as well as the prospects for inflation to return sustainably to target. These projections depend
importantly on three main judgements: that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices broadly as
projected, and without adverse consequences for inflation expectations further ahead; that regular pay growth remains
modest in the near term but picks up significantly over the forecast period; and that more subdued household spending
growth is largely balanced by a pickup in other components of demand.
In judging the appropriate policy stance, the Committee will be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding
these and other factors. Monetary policy can respond in either direction to changes to the economic outlook as they
unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. On the whole, the Committee judges that, if the
economy follows a path broadly consistent with the May central projection, then monetary policy could need to be
tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than the very gently rising path implied by the market
yield curve underlying the May projections. 
Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 1
1 Global economic and financial
market developments
Indicators point to continued solid global GDP growth in the near term, and equity prices have
risen further. Probably reflecting changing perceptions among investors over the risks to growth,
market interest rates have fluctuated in many advanced economies, and they have fallen in the
United Kingdom. The sustainability of current rates of global GDP growth in the medium term is
likely to depend on a recovery in productivity growth in many advanced economies.
The outlook for global growth is somewhat stronger than
anticipated in February. While quarterly global GDP growth,
weighted by countries’ shares in UK exports, is estimated to
have slowed slightly to 0.5% in 2017 Q1 (Table 1.A), growth is
projected to recover to 0.7% in Q2. The slowing in Q1 largely
reflected a weaker-than-expected figure for the United States,
but that appears to reflect temporary factors (Section 1.2).
Growth was in line with expectations in the euro area
(Section 1.1) and slightly stronger than expected in China
(Section 1.3).
A range of indicators point to continued momentum across a
number of countries, particularly in the euro area and
United States. Survey indicators of current activity growth
have remained high (Chart 1.1), while there has been a sharp
rise in growth in global trade and capital goods orders
(Chart 1.2), and consumer and business confidence remain
buoyant (Chart 1.3). These developments have been
associated with upward revisions to growth forecasts for 2017.
For example, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has
revised up its projection for global GDP growth in 2017, its first
upward revision to near-term growth since 2011.
Since the February Report, US and euro-area short-term and
long-term interest rates have fluctuated. While most of those
rates were, overall, little changed in the run-up to the
May Report, US long-term interest rates had fallen slightly
(Chart 1.4). According to market contacts, those fluctuations
were likely to have reflected changing expectations over: the
scale and timing of fiscal stimulus in the United States; the
implications of European political developments; and broader
geopolitical risks. Financial market implied volatilities rose
from low levels in mid-April, but have since fallen back
(Chart 1.5). In contrast to moves in other countries, the
market-implied path for UK short-term interest rates flattened
(Chart 1.6 and Section 1.4) and UK longer-term interest rates
fell steadily (Chart 1.4). That may in part reflect a less
optimistic view among market participants of likely UK growth
prospects in coming years relative to growth in other
countries.

2 Inflation Report May 2017
Euro-area and US equity prices have risen further since
February (Chart 1.7), largely reflecting higher earnings
expectations as a result of the stronger outlook for growth, on
top of an improvement in risk sentiment over the past
six months. UK equity prices have also risen since February,
but only slightly (Chart 1.7). That underperformance is in part
likely to reflect the effects of the recent appreciation in
sterling on the value of companies’ foreign currency earnings.
In the run-up to the May Report, the sterling ERI was 2½%
higher than three months earlier, but was still 16% lower than
its peak in November 2015 (Chart 1.8).
The recoveries in GDP growth across advanced economies in
recent years have been largely met by increased employment,
with productivity growth remaining weak (Chart 1.9).(1) As a
result, much of the slack in labour markets in many countries
that opened up following the financial crisis appears to have
been absorbed. The medium-term sustainability of the recent
pace of global GDP growth is therefore likely to depend on a
recovery in trend productivity growth.
The extent of the remaining spare capacity differs across
economies, however. For example, the unemployment rate is
around its pre-crisis low in the United Kingdom and
United States, but remains above it in the euro area
(Chart 1.10). Probably reflecting that additional degree of
spare capacity, wage growth and core inflation remain weaker
in the euro area than in other advanced economies, although
even in the United States core inflation is slightly below its
past average (Table 1.B).
Measures of headline consumer price inflation in the euro area,
the United States and globally have all risen more sharply than
core inflation over the past year, to broadly around past
averages (Table 1.B). That largely reflects the rise in global oil
prices during 2016, following falls in 2014–15 (Chart 1.11).
That rise is in turn likely to have been driven by both the
recovery in global demand growth and an agreement in
November between OPEC and some non-OPEC oil producers
to reduce oil production. In the near term, world consumer
price inflation is projected to pick up further.
Since the February Report, US dollar oil prices have been
volatile. In the fifteen working days to 3 May, oil prices were
on average 5% lower than in February (Chart 1.11). They have,
however, fallen further since the MPC’s projections were
finalised. One driver of those falls appears to have been higher
oil production and inventories in the United States.
By influencing production and transport costs, global
commodity prices and inflation more broadly are also
important drivers of the prices of other internationally traded

goods. Annual world export price inflation excluding oil is
estimated to have risen sharply over the past year, to 2.4% in
2017 Q1 (Table 1.B). That will push up UK import price
inflation (Section 4), as will the past fall in sterling.
1.1 The euro area
As the United Kingdom’s largest trading partner,
developments in the euro-area economy are important for
UK growth. Quarterly euro-area GDP growth was stable at
0.5% in Q1 (Table 1.A). That was as expected in February
(Table 1.C), and slightly higher than average growth in recent
years.
The recovery in euro-area growth in recent years has narrowed
the degree of slack in the economy. The unemployment rate
has continued to fall steadily reaching 9.5% in March, around
2 percentage points above its 2007–08 low (Chart 1.10).
Despite that, four-quarter wage growth remained well below
its past average rate at 1.5% in Q4. While weak productivity
growth (Chart 1.9) is likely to have weighed on wage growth, a
degree of spare capacity appears to persist.
Despite the weakness in euro-area wage growth, core inflation
has risen in recent months to 1.2% in April (Table 1.B). Much
of that rise is likely to have been erratic, however, reflecting
the timing of the Easter holidays relative to 2016. Core
inflation is projected to fall back in May.
Financial conditions in the euro area remain supportive of
growth. As expected by market contacts, the European
Central Bank (ECB) made no changes to monetary policy at its
March and April meetings. As announced in December 2016,
the ECB reduced its rate of asset purchases from €80 billion
per month to €60 billion in April, and intends to continue
these purchases until December 2017. The market-implied
path for short-term interest rates (Chart 1.6) and longer-term
government bond yields (Chart 1.4) have fluctuated, however,
as have measures of investors’ uncertainty (Chart 1.5). Market
contacts attributed these developments in part to rising
uncertainty ahead of the first round of the French presidential
election on 23 April. Retail interest rates remain supportive of
spending and, according to the ECB Bank Lending Survey, credit
supply has improved. Credit conditions should also be
supported by a substantial increase in March in the amount
banks borrowed under the ECB’s targeted longer-term
refinancing operations, the interest rates on which are
structured to incentivise lending to the real economy.
Survey indicators of euro-area activity (Chart 1.1) and
sentiment (Chart 1.3) have risen further in recent months.
Consistent with those buoyant indicators, quarterly GDP
growth is expected to pick up slightly to 0.6% in Q2, a little
stronger than projected at the time of the February Report

(Table 1.C). Further ahead, the outlook for growth is also
stronger (Section 5).
1.2 The United States
Developments in the United States matter for the
United Kingdom both due to their implications for trade and
via their impact on global financial markets. Quarterly
US GDP growth dipped from 0.5% in Q4 to 0.2% in Q1
(Table 1.A), lower than expected in the February Report
(Table 1.C). That appears to have been due to erratic factors.
Consumption growth was weak, partly reflecting both a delay
to the implementation of a rebate on income tax and
unusually warm weather depressing utilities consumption. In
addition, stockbuilding dragged on growth. The GDP growth
outturn in Q1 was in contrast to robust survey indicators of
activity growth and confidence (Charts 1.1 and 1.3), and
growth in investment was strong. Most of the weakness in
GDP is therefore projected to unwind in Q2.
Monthly US employment growth remained solid at 180,000
on average in the first four months of the year, and the
unemployment rate fell further to 4.4% in April (Chart 1.10).
That is around its pre-crisis trough and, overall, most of the
slack remaining in the US labour market appears to have been
absorbed. Reflecting that, as well as a modest pickup in
productivity growth, wage growth is projected to continue to
rise steadily in coming quarters back towards its pre-crisis
average rate.
Reflecting the improving economic outlook, on 15 March the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target
range for the federal funds rate from between ½% and ¾% to
between ¾% and 1% (Chart 1.6). That was in line with
market expectations. The median of FOMC members’
expected future paths for interest rates, which embody further
rises in coming years, was unrevised for 2017 and 2018 but
revised up slightly for 2019. At the FOMC meeting on 3 May,
policy was unchanged.
Having tightened somewhat in response to the improving
growth outlook between the November 2016 and
February 2017 Reports, US financial conditions have overall
been broadly stable over the past three months. In the run-up
to the May Report, the path for short-term interest rates was
broadly unchanged (Chart 1.6), while long-term government
bond yields (Chart 1.4) and the US dollar were both slightly
lower than in February. Equity prices have risen further in
recent months (Chart 1.7), but lending to the corporate sector
has moderated.
US GDP growth is projected to rise to 0.8% in Q2, as some of
the weakness in Q1 is unwound, before falling back a little
through the rest of the year (Table 1.C). Growth in coming
years is projected to be supported by some degree of fiscal

the precise composition, timing and scale of any fiscal package
(Section 5).
1.3 Emerging market economies
Four-quarter growth in China has been robust in recent
quarters and was 6.9% in 2017 Q1 (Table 1.A). That was
stronger than expected in February (Table 1.C), in part
reflecting strength in industrial and infrastructure activity.
Survey indicators, such as the Caixin composite PMI and
consumer confidence measures, together with the authorities’
growth target for 2017, point to continued robust growth in
the near term. That outlook is slightly stronger than projected
in February.
Credit growth in China has remained very strong, raising
concerns about financial stability over the medium term.
Total social financing — a broad measure of private sector
credit — grew by around 13% in the year to March. The
authorities have raised short-term interest rates in recent
months, in part to reduce the risk of capital outflows and to
slow the rate of build-up of risks to financial stability more
broadly. Aggregate house price inflation has eased following
the introduction of macroprudential measures to slow the
market, but it remained robust at around 11% in the year to
March. Overall, there remain significant challenges for the
authorities in maintaining GDP growth while reducing risks to
financial stability.
Having slowed in preceding years (Table 1.A), growth in other
emerging market economies (EMEs) appears to have stabilised
over the past year. Recent survey indicators of activity suggest
that Russia has emerged from recession in recent quarters and
that the pace of contraction in the Brazilian economy has
eased, broadly consistent with the modest rise in overall EME
growth projected at the time of the February Report.
That stabilisation in EME growth is likely in part to have
reflected an easing in financial conditions and, in those EMEs
that are net commodity exporters, the recovery in commodity
prices. Investor confidence appears to have recovered
somewhat, with net inflows of private sector capital into EMEs
and rises in EME equity prices (Chart 1.7) and currencies in
recent months. In recent years, several major EMEs appear to
have increased their resilience to macroeconomic shocks,
which may have supported investor sentiment. Current
account deficits have narrowed and foreign exchange reserves
have risen in some countries. EMEs should also benefit from
the improvement in the outlook for advanced-economy
growth. Nevertheless, the stock of dollar-denominated debt
in some EMEs remains high and the cost of repaying that debt
may be sensitive to faster-than-expected increases in
US interest rates and any further strengthening in the
US dollar.

6 Inflation Report May 2017
The long-term outlook for interest rates
As set out in the box on pages 8–9 of the November 2016
Report, both short-term and longer-term interest rates have
fallen over the past few decades across advanced economies.
Some of the recent declines are likely to reflect cyclical
factors, such as heightened risk aversion, with many
economies having experienced similar shocks and policy
responses during and after the financial crisis. Interest rates
have been declining globally for some time, however. The
transition in many advanced economies to a lower inflation
environment will have contributed to some of that decline.
But measures of real interest rates — which strip out the
effects of inflation — have also declined significantly over
time. Given the highly integrated nature of global capital
markets, a key factor behind the declines in real interest rates
is likely to have been structural shifts in global investment and
saving preferences, such as those arising from the increasing
average age of the population.(1)
The long-term outlook for interest rates is uncertain, but is of
key importance for both the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC) and the Financial Policy Committee (FPC). On 5 April,
the Committees met to discuss, and were presented with
material from ongoing work on, the long-term outlook for
interest rates. This box summarises the material presented at
that meeting.
Financial market expectations of future UK interest
rates
One set of market-based measures of the outlook for real
interest rates are those implied by long-term government
bond yields. Those long-term real interest rates will reflect
both expected future short-term rates and term premia, the
additional compensation that investors require for holding
longer-maturity assets. In order to isolate the expected future
short-term real interest rates embodied in bond yields, it is
therefore necessary to strip out an estimate of term premia.
One way of estimating those term premia and expected future
interest rates is by using so-called ‘term structure’ models of
the past relationship between bond yields at different
horizons. Chart A shows expected UK short-term real interest
rates ten years ahead, based on four of those models. The
models suggest that, even though term premia have declined
in recent decades, there has been a substantial decline in
expected future short-term real interest rates, with a marked
fall following the financial crisis. The average of the estimates
is currently ¼%, far below the 1993–2007 average of around
2¾%. That is consistent with the real policy rate — the
difference between Bank Rate and CPI inflation — staying low
for some time to come. There is, however, a wide range of
estimates from these models, and uncertainty about how well
they capture expectations.
Drivers of low current and expected future interest
rates
As set out in the box in the November Report, there are
several factors that are likely to have pushed down real
interest rates over time. One will have been the impact of
global demographic trends on desired saving. Increasing life
expectancy is likely to have led individuals to seek to save a
greater proportion of their income if they expect to spend
longer in retirement. And the share of the global population
at stages of life associated with higher rates of saving — in
particular, those in the 45–64 age group — has risen. That
increase in desired saving will have weighed on real interest
rates.
In addition, desired investment appears to have fallen,
particularly following the financial crisis. That is likely to
reflect heightened risk aversion and perceptions of downside
risks to the outlook for demand, while downward revisions to
expected growth of global GDP and productivity will also have
lowered investment demand.

(a) End-month data to March 2017. The swathe shows estimates from four models. Three of
the models estimate the nominal policy rate, and are adjusted for inflation expectations;
one model jointly estimates nominal and real interest rates using RPI inflation. Nominal
interest rates are zero-coupon ten-year forward rates derived from UK government bond
prices. Inflation expectations estimates are for inflation five to ten years ahead from the
half-yearly Consensus survey, and are assumed constant in the intervening months. They are
based on RPI inflation until 2005 and CPI inflation thereafter; prior to 2005, the estimates
are adjusted by the difference between RPI and CPI inflation. Expected policy rates are
derived by stripping out term premia estimated using the following four models: the
benchmark model in Malik, S and Meldrum, A (2014), ‘Evaluating the robustness of UK term
structure decompositions using linear regression methods’, Bank of England Working Paper

Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 7
1.4 Sterling financial markets
The strengthening in global GDP growth should support
UK exports (Section 2). Global developments, alongside
domestic conditions, also matter for UK asset prices. As
described in the box on pages 39–41, one factor supporting
UK GDP growth over the past year appears to have been an
improvement in UK asset prices and financial conditions,
which in part reflects the pickup in global sentiment over that
period.
Interest rates and exchange rates
The MPC voted to make no changes to monetary policy at its
March meeting, as set out in the box on page 8. The details of
the May decision are contained in the Monetary Policy
Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and in more detail in the
Minutes of the meeting.
In the run-up to the May Report, both the market-implied path
for short-term UK interest rates (Chart 1.6) and longer-term
interest rates (Chart 1.4) were lower than at the time of the
February Report. In recent months, the difference between
long-term rates in the United States and the United Kingdom
has been around its widest since 2000. According to market
contacts, these developments appear to reflect a less
optimistic view among market participants of UK growth
prospects in coming years relative to those in the rest of the
world.
Changes in nominal interest rates will reflect movements in
both real interest rates and inflation compensation. The fall in
UK long-term interest rates between the February and May
Reports reflects falls in both components. The level of
inflation compensation is broadly around its past average
(Chart 1.12). Real interest rates remain low globally and the
box on pages 6–7 discusses some of the factors that are likely
Implications for the MPC and FPC
One consequence of these trends is the low levels of interest
rates set by monetary policy makers in many countries,
including those in the United Kingdom. Had the MPC failed to
track this trend, policy would have been too tight and inflation
and output too low.
The persistence of these factors will be crucial for the
long-term outlook for UK real interest rates and for the path
of monetary policy over coming years. Demographic effects
are likely to persist for a long time yet. And global
productivity growth may well remain below pre-crisis rates for
some time to come. But the future rate of productivity
growth is highly uncertain, and market expectations of interest
rates can change quickly and may be influenced by perceptions
of risk. There is, therefore, considerable uncertainty over how
persistent the period of low global interest rates will be.
The outlook for interest rates will also be important for the
FPC in identifying, monitoring, and taking action to reduce,
risks to financial stability. As set out in the November 2016
Financial Stability Report, a rapid rise in interest rates could be
associated with falls in a range of asset prices, particularly if it
does not coincide with a substantially improved
macroeconomic outlook. Persistently low interest rates,
however, could adversely affect the profitability of financial
institutions, and this is one element of the exploratory
scenario in the Bank’s 2017 stress test of the UK banking
system.(1)

Monetary policy since the February Report
The MPC’s central projection in the February Report was for
four-quarter GDP growth to slow over 2017 and continue to
be subdued during 2018–19. Consumption growth was
projected to slow, as households adjusted their spending to
lower real income growth. In addition, the anticipation of
changes in future trading arrangements, and the uncertainty
around those, was expected to restrain business activity and
supply growth. Largely due to the depreciation in sterling,
CPI inflation was expected soon to rise above the 2% target
and to reach around 2¾% in mid-2018, before falling back
gradually. That central projection was conditioned on: the
path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates; the
announced Term Funding Scheme; the stock of purchased
gilts remaining at £435 billion; and the stock of purchased
corporate bonds reaching and remaining at £10 billion.
At its meeting ending on 15 March, the MPC noted that
measures of overall UK activity growth had continued to be
resilient, and there had been relatively little evidence so far
from the output indicators of a slowdown. Several indicators
had, however, been consistent with a slowing in consumer
spending growth, particularly successive falls in retail sales,
although evidence of a broader consumption slowdown had
been mixed. Given more positive global survey data, the
central outlook for global activity appeared to be stronger.
CPI inflation had been 1.8% in January, fractionally below
Bank staff’s expectation at the time of the February Report.
The net result of the news in the January CPI outturn, the
announced utility price rises in excess of the February forecast
assumptions, and the decline in the sterling oil price was to
leave the staff’s expectation for CPI inflation broadly similar to
the February projection. Wage growth had, however, been
notably softer than expected, despite a further fall in the
unemployment rate.
The MPC’s best collective view was that the conditioning
assumption that had underpinned the February projections
— that there would be some modest withdrawal of monetary
stimulus over the course of the forecast period — remained
appropriate. Some members noted that it would take
relatively little further upside news on the prospects for
activity or inflation for them to consider a more immediate
reduction in policy support. For one member, the monetary
policy trade-off had evolved to justify an immediate increase
in Bank Rate.
to have contributed to the low level of UK real interest rates in
recent years.
Sterling has continued to be volatile, with a sharp appreciation
on the day that a UK general election was announced, possibly
reflecting an increase in the weight that market participants
are placing on a smooth, rather than disorderly, Brexit process.
In the run-up to the May Report, the sterling ERI was 2½%
higher than at the time of the February Report, though it was
16% lower than its peak in November 2015 (Chart 1.8).
Corporate capital markets
Developments in capital markets matter for the ability and
cost with which UK companies can raise finance. While it has
underperformed its international equivalents in recent weeks,
the FTSE All-Share index has risen somewhat over the past
year (Chart 1.7). Nevertheless, that pickup may not have
materially reduced the cost of equity finance for many
companies, as much of it is likely simply to reflect the direct
impact of the depreciation in the exchange rate on the sterling
value of foreign currency earnings. Consistent with that, the
equity prices of UK domestically focused companies — those
for which at least 70% of revenue is earned in the
United Kingdom — have risen by less than global equity prices
over the past year (Chart 1.13).
Companies can also raise finance by issuing corporate bonds.
In April, the Bank completed its purchase of £10 billion of
investment-grade corporate bonds under the Corporate Bond

announcement, the cost of issuing sterling corporate bonds
fell and corporate bond issuance rose sharply for a period.
The yields on both investment-grade and riskier, so-called
‘high-yield’, sterling corporate bonds have fallen since the
February Report (Chart 1.14). That reflects the fall in
UK government bond yields (Chart 1.4), with little change in
the additional compensation that investors require for the
riskiness of the company. Despite that fall in yields, overall
net external finance raised by companies was slightly lower in
Q1 than in Q4 (Section 2).
Capital markets also matter for broader credit conditions
through their influence on bank funding costs. The spreads
that banks pay for funding over and above benchmark interest
rates have, on average, fallen slightly further since February
(Chart 1.15). Bank funding and lending conditions overall
remain broadly supportive of growth, although the Credit
Conditions Survey suggests some tightening in consumer credit
supply (Section 2).

10 Inflation Report May 2017
2 Demand and output
Output growth slowed to 0.3% in the preliminary estimate for Q1. That was probably driven by
slower household spending growth, which is projected to remain weak over 2017 as higher import
prices weigh on households’ purchasing power. Business investment fell in 2016 but most surveys
point to a modest pickup in investment growth over 2017. The depreciation of sterling and strength
in global demand have supported net trade and should continue to do so.
GDP growth slowed sharply in Q1 to 0.3%, according to
the preliminary estimate, although growth is projected to be
revised up to 0.4% in the mature estimate (Chart 2.1). That
was 0.1 percentage points weaker than expected at the time of
the February Report. GDP growth is projected to be stable at
0.4% in Q2, consistent with a preliminary estimate of 0.3%.
The CBI and Markit/CIPS indicators of current activity growth
rose in April but the measures of expected growth fell. Taken
together with other indicators, such as weak new car
registrations in April, these are consistent with broadly
unchanged growth in Q2.
Much of the slowing in GDP growth in Q1 was concentrated in
the service sector (Chart 2.2). Within that, growth in certain
consumer‑facing subsectors, such as retail trade and
accommodation services, was particularly weak. That is
consistent with a slowing in real household spending growth
as higher import prices weigh on households’ purchasing
power (Section 2.1). Household consumption growth is
projected to remain weak in coming quarters (Table 2.A) as
rises in import prices continue to pass through.
In contrast, manufacturing output growth in Q1 remained at
around its average pace over 2016. This is likely to have
reflected support to the export sector from sterling’s
depreciation. Net trade is expected to continue to be
supported by the depreciation and strength in global demand
(Section 2.3). The supportive conditions facing the export
sector should contribute towards a modest recovery in
business investment growth in 2017 (Section 2.4).
2.1 Household spending and the housing
market
Household consumption growth was robust at 0.7% in Q4
(Table 2.B). But weaker‑than‑expected output growth,
together with the sharp fall in retail sales in Q1 (Chart 2.3),
suggest that consumption growth slowed sharply in Q1 and by
more than expected in February.

Section 2 Demand and output 11
Consumption growth is projected to remain weak in coming
quarters (Table 2.A), driven by weak household income
growth. In recent years, despite modest growth in average
wages (Section 3), increases in employment pushed up
aggregate income. Real income growth was also boosted by
falls in food and energy prices (Chart 2.4). However, annual
real labour income growth slowed over 2016 as that boost
faded. It is projected to continue to slow over 2017 as rising
import prices feed through to higher retail prices (Section 4).
While current income is an important determinant of
spending, consumption is also affected by changes in the
amount households save or borrow. The headline saving ratio
fell from 5.3% in 2016 Q3 to 3.3% in Q4, its lowest level since
the series began in 1963. As explained in the box on
pages 16–17, however, much of this fall was driven by
weakness in components of income that tend to be less
relevant for households’ spending decisions.(1) Some of these
income components also tend to be volatile so the headline
saving ratio is expected to have risen slightly in 2017 Q1.
How much income households choose to spend rather than
save is likely to be influenced by their confidence in future
income growth. The GfK measure of consumer confidence has
remained a little above its historical average in recent months
(Chart 2.3), suggesting some resilience in consumption
growth in the near term.
In addition, the extent to which households finance their
consumption by borrowing will depend on the cost and
availability of consumer credit. Credit conditions have eased
in recent years as bank funding costs have fallen (Section 1)
and competition between lenders has intensified. Rates on
£10,000 personal loans are currently around record lows
(Table 2.C). And in the credit card market, the average
interest‑free period on credit card balance transfers has
increased, while fees charged on balance transfers have fallen.
This easing in credit conditions, together with an increase in
demand for credit in 2016 as reported by lenders in the
Credit Conditions Survey (CCS), has been associated with a
marked increase in consumer credit growth (Chart 2.5).(2)
Annual growth in consumer credit slowed slightly in March, to
10.2% (Chart 2.5). While strong competition in a number of
consumer credit markets appears to have continued, on
balance lenders responding to the CCS expected availability to
tighten in Q2. The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has
launched a review into the credit quality of new consumer
lending by a cross‑section of PRA‑regulated lenders, and the
(1) The box on pages 16–17 also describes forthcoming revisions to the household saving
ratio in Blue Book 2017.
(2) Structural changes in the consumer credit market — in particular the increased
availability of dealership car finance in recent years — have also contributed to
increased consumer credit growth. For more details, see Section 2.1 of the
February 2017 Report; www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/
2017/feb.aspx.

Table 2.A Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements 
12 Inflation Report May 2017
Financial Conduct Authority has launched a review into its
rules and guidance on creditworthiness assessments used in
the consumer credit market.
One indication that consumption growth may slow further in
Q2 is the sharp fall in private new car registrations in April.
Some of that fall is likely to reflect the impact of changes to
vehicle tax rates that came into effect in April, leading to some
purchases being brought forward. But the number of car
registrations in the three months to April was 2.8% lower than
a year earlier, and the fall in April is likely to weigh on
consumption growth in Q2.
Activity in the housing market can also be correlated with
consumption growth. As explained in the box on pages 18–19
of the November 2016 Report, this is probably because the
decisions about whether to buy a house and how much to
consume tend to be driven by common factors such as income
growth and confidence. Rises in house prices can also affect
spending directly by raising the value of homeowners’ equity,
which they can then use as collateral against which to borrow,
although this effect is estimated to be small.
The outlook for the housing market is slightly weaker than
expected in February (Table 2.A). Annualised house price
inflation fell to 0.7% in the three months to April, according to
the average of the Halifax/Markit and Nationwide indices
(Chart 2.6). House price inflation is expected to slow further
in the near term, before recovering further ahead. Mortgage
approvals were broadly unchanged in Q1, a little lower than
expected three months ago. And the number of mortgage
completions remained around 2% lower than a year ago in
February, primarily due to continued weakness in buy‑to‑let
completions. In contrast, first‑time buyer completions
increased. Approvals are projected to rise only slightly in the
near term.
The outlook for the housing market will also depend on the
cost and availability of mortgages. Mortgage interest rates
have fallen markedly in recent years to historical lows
(Table 2.C). That should continue to support housing activity.
Secured lending growth, however, slowed slightly in March
and remains substantially lower than prior to the crisis
(Chart 2.5).
Activity in the housing market will also directly affect GDP
through housing investment. Around a quarter of housing
investment reflects spending on services associated with
property transactions, while the remainder comprises new
building and improvements to existing properties. Private
sector housing investment fell in 2016 Q2 and Q3 but rose by
1.6% in Q4 (Table 2.B), driven mostly by a rise in new
dwellings investment. Housing starts have increased sharply
(Chart 2.7), which is likely to feed through to higher housing
investment in coming quarters as those homes are built.

2.2 Government spending
The MPC’s forecasts are conditioned on the Government’s
tax and spending plans detailed in the Spring 2017 Budget.
Under these plans, the fiscal consolidation is set to continue,
but the pace of consolidation is slightly slower than in the
2016 Autumn Statement. That change provides a small boost
to GDP over the forecast period compared with the
projections in February. Under the Charter for Budget
Responsibility, the Government has a fiscal mandate to reduce
cyclically adjusted net borrowing to below 2% of GDP by
2020/21, supplemented by a target for public sector net debt
as a percentage of GDP to be falling in 2020/21 and for some
welfare spending to be subject to a cap of £126 billion in
2021/22.
2.3 Net trade and the current account
Sterling has risen by 2½% since the February Report, but it is
16% below its peak in November 2015 (Section 1). That
depreciation should support net trade through two key
channels. First, the lower value of sterling should prompt new
and existing exporters to expand production. Second, higher
import prices should encourage UK households and businesses
to substitute towards domestically produced goods and
services and away from imported goods and services. There is
uncertainty as to the timing and size of both of these effects,
however, and the extent of the boost to net trade will depend
partly on how companies anticipate and respond to Brexit.(1)
Bank staff estimate that underlying net trade added around
0.6 percentage points to GDP growth in 2016 Q4, more than
expected in February. The headline net trade contribution was
greater (Table 2.B), but mainly reflected a large export of
non‑monetary gold. This is a volatile component of UK trade,
reflecting activity in the London gold bullion market, and has
no impact on aggregate demand; movements in
non‑monetary gold are offset by movements in private sector
investment in valuables.(2)
Exports
Within net trade, UK exports increased by 2.6% in 2016 Q4,
excluding the impact of non‑monetary gold and other
valuables. That was broadly in line with expectations at the
time of the February Report. UK exports are projected to grow
modestly in 2017, but by a little more than projected in
February, consistent with the pickup in survey indicators of
export orders and deliveries in Q1 (Chart 2.8).

14 Inflation Report May 2017
Both the past depreciation in sterling and strength in global
demand (Section 1) are likely to support UK export growth in
coming quarters. The past depreciation of sterling may lead
exporters to reduce some of their foreign currency prices, in
which case their competitiveness and demand from abroad
should increase. Alternatively, to the extent that exporters
maintain their prices in foreign currency terms, their profit
margins will be supported in sterling terms, which should
support expansion in their production capacity. Since the end
of 2015, export prices in sterling terms have risen by 12%.
The outlook for export growth, however, also depends on the
eventual consequences of Brexit for the United Kingdom’s
trading arrangements and how companies anticipate and
respond to these (Section 5).(1)
Imports
Excluding the impact of non‑monetary gold and other
valuables, staff estimate that UK imports rose by 0.4% in Q4.
UK imports are expected to grow modestly in 2017, though by
a little more than expected in February. When combined with
the expected near‑term increase in export growth, net trade is
projected to provide a small boost to overall demand in 2017,
broadly as anticipated in February (Table 2.A).
Current account
The current account reflects the balance of nominal trade
flows and other payments between the United Kingdom and
the rest of the world. The current account deficit narrowed in
Q4 to 2.4% of GDP (Chart 2.9), compared with 4.4%
expected in February. That narrowing mainly reflected a
reduction in the trade deficit, which was driven in part by
erratic factors such as the trade in non‑monetary gold
described above, and so is likely to partly unwind in 2017 Q1.
The deficit on primary income — the net value of investment
income received by UK residents — also narrowed. This
narrowing was partly due to an increase in the sterling value of
earnings on UK foreign direct investment, largely reflecting the
depreciation in sterling over the past 18 months.
The extent to which the United Kingdom can continue to run a
current account deficit will partly reflect the net international
investment position (NIIP) — the stock of UK foreign assets
less the liabilities owed to other countries. Since UK residents
hold more foreign currency assets than liabilities, sterling’s
depreciation will have contributed to an improvement in the
NIIP. According to the ONS, the NIIP rose to 24% of GDP in
Q4, the highest since records began in 1977.
The ONS has announced changes to the measurement of the
current account deficit ahead of Pink Book 2017, which will
lead to an increase in the estimated size of the deficit.(2) The

majority of the increase is due to higher estimates for the
amount of interest being paid abroad on UK corporate bonds.
Provisional ONS estimates suggest that the current account
deficit, as a proportion of GDP, is likely to be revised around
0.5 percentage points wider on average between 1997 and
2012. Figures for more recent years will be published in
August.
2.4 Business investment
Business investment fell over 2016 as a whole and by 0.9% in
Q4 (Table 2.B). The Bank’s Agents report that heightened
uncertainty was the primary cause, in part as companies
postponed larger investment decisions until they became
more certain about the outlook following the Brexit vote. But
other factors, including falls in extraction sector investment
following the decline in oil prices during 2014–15 and weaker
global growth prospects in the first half of 2016, also
contributed to the fall. As a consequence of the low level of
investment in recent years, growth in the total capital stock
per worker — the resources and equipment available to
produce output — has remained subdued (Section 3).
Most survey measures of investment intentions, however,
picked up slightly in 2017 Q1 (Chart 2.10). And according to
the latest Deloitte CFO Survey, the net balance of respondents
who are prioritising expansionary strategies has increased. As
such, business investment is expected to have grown by 0.8%
in the four quarters to Q1. The pickup in investment
intentions may partly reflect the resilience in UK demand in
2016 (Table 2.B). And the combined impact of the strength in
world demand and the depreciation in sterling (Section 2.3)
will have increased exporters’ desire to invest. Furthermore,
the rate of return on capital as measured by the ONS remains
relatively high.
Corporate credit conditions are also likely to be supporting
business investment. The cost of issuing corporate bonds has
fallen slightly since February (Section 1), while interest rates
on new and outstanding business loans have been broadly
unchanged, having fallen following the monetary policy
measures announced in August. Lenders responding to the
CCS expected the cost and availability of credit for businesses
to remain broadly unchanged in 2017 Q2. Despite this
stability in credit conditions, however, net external finance
raised was slightly lower in Q1 than in 2016 Q4 (Table 2.D).
Set against that support, uncertainty surrounding the
United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements is likely to
weigh on firms’ investment intentions in coming years. For
example, to the extent that the fall in sterling reflects the
likelihood that the costs of exporting for some businesses will
go up, firms may choose to hold off investment decisions until
they become more certain about the outlook. The Bank’s
Agents report that a number of exporters and foreign‑owned

16 Inflation Report May 2017
Understanding the household saving ratio
Household spending is the largest single component of
demand. It is determined not only by how much income
people receive but also how much of that income they save.
For any individual, those choices are likely to vary over their
lifetime. For example, those near the start of their working
life, when incomes tend to be lower, are more likely to borrow
to supplement their income; then, as their income rises,
subsequently to save some of it or repay that borrowing. But
cyclical factors also tend to affect saving decisions, including
the cost of borrowing and people’s confidence about the
future (Section 2.1).
One summary measure of those decisions is the aggregate
saving ratio, which shows saving relative to total household
income. Changes in that ratio can indicate whether
households are collectively saving more or less than in the
past and are one possible indicator of whether current growth
in consumption is likely to be sustained. According to the
latest published data, the saving ratio fell to 3.3% in 2016 Q4
— its lowest since the series began in 1963 (Chart A).
As this box sets out, however, income is made up of many
components, not all of which may be important for current
spending decisions. In addition, estimates of income can often
be subject to revision, including those recently announced by
the ONS as part of Blue Book 2017 described below.
Accounting for changes in the saving ratio
The majority of income for many households comes from
wages, salaries or self‑employment income. Total labour
income, after taxes, currently accounts for a little over half of
total household income as measured by the ONS.
Other people receive a substantial proportion of their income
from government benefits or private pensions, which together
account for a further quarter of total household income. All
these types of income tend to be easily accessible and fairly
regular, so probably play a major role in spending decisions.
While most households hold financial investments indirectly
as part of their pension wealth, some also directly hold
financial investments, which earn an income in terms of
dividends or interest payments. And many will receive interest
payments on deposit accounts and/or pay interest on debt.
These categories form part of ‘non‑labour income’. They may
be a significant determinant of spending for some, although
for others they may be less important for day‑to‑day
spending — for example investors may automatically reinvest
dividends.
The remainder of non‑labour income is unlikely to be relevant
for current spending decisions, since households cannot
generally access it directly. For homeowners, the ONS
attempts to capture the implicit ‘income’ or value they get
from living in their house. This is matched by an equal amount
of consumption so saving out of this is zero by construction.
In addition, non‑labour income includes the pension
contributions made by employers, as well as the investment
income earned on behalf of households by pension funds and
insurance companies, net of the income paid out to existing
retirees. These types of income may be less relevant for
current spending decisions; nonetheless they may affect
spending in the long run, for example when people retire.
Over 2016, much of the fall in the aggregate saving ratio was
driven by falls in non‑labour income. In particular, investment
income earned on behalf of households by pension funds and
insurance companies fell sharply in Q4. By contrast, the sum
of labour and benefit income increased slightly. More
generally, over the past two decades, labour and benefit
income has risen relative to consumption, while the ratio of
total household income to consumption has fallen (Chart B).
In other words, it is changes in non‑labour income that have
driven the saving ratio lower over this period. But as explained
below, forthcoming revisions as part of Blue Book 2017 are
likely to mean that the saving ratio has fallen by less than the
current data suggest.
Forthcoming changes in Blue Book 2017
The ONS has announced changes to the measurement of
household income ahead of Blue Book 2017. These are likely
to have substantial implications for the aggregate household
saving ratio.(1) Provisional estimates suggest that the saving
ratio will be revised up by 0.8 percentage points on average
between 1997 and 2012 (Chart C). The size of these revisions

Section 2 Demand and output 17
increases over time, however, such that the saving ratio is
estimated to have been 1.5 percentage points higher in 2012.
The majority of the revision to the aggregate saving ratio
results from a switch to using HMRC tax data to estimate
dividend income, part of ‘non‑labour income’.(1) These data
suggest that there has been a marked rise over the past
decade in the number of self‑employed workers who have
chosen to incorporate their businesses, that had not previously
been captured in the ONS income data. In addition to paying
themselves as employees, many of these individuals also take
income in the form of dividends from their companies.
Including this dividend income has raised the estimated level
of total household income, which — since household
consumption is unchanged — pushes up the saving ratio.
Accordingly, this increase in household income is estimated to
have been offset by a decrease in the corporate sector
financial balance.
Figures for more recent years will be published in August 2017.
Since an increasing number of the self‑employed have become
incorporated after 2012, all else equal it is likely that
household income will be revised more significantly in recent
years. If so, the new estimates are likely to show that the
saving ratio has fallen less sharply. And, because dividend
income is likely to be an important source of income for
self‑employed households, these revisions are likely to mean
that this element of non‑labour income has become
increasingly relevant for household consumption over time.
(1) A number of other small changes have been made to the measurement of income in
the household and non‑profit institutions serving households (NPISH) sectors (the
NPISH sector includes universities, trade unions, political parties, further education
colleges and most charities). But these changes are far less significant than the
change to dividend income described in this box. Currently, estimates for the
household and NPISH sectors are presented jointly in the National Accounts, but
these will be separated in Blue Book 2017.

firms remain cautious about larger investment decisions due
to uncertainty around future UK trading arrangements. In
addition, the sterling depreciation is likely to have raised the
cost of business investment: with the exception of buildings
(around one quarter of investment spending), investment is
relatively import‑intensive.
Overall, the near‑term outlook for business investment is
judged to be somewhat stronger than projected in February
(Table 2.A). Nevertheless, growth in the capital stock is
projected to remain subdued (Section 5).

18 Inflation Report May 2017
3 Supply and the labour market
Wage growth has remained modest in recent months, and employment growth has been subdued.
While unemployment has continued to fall, a little slack is judged to remain in the economy. And
although productivity growth picked up in 2016, it is expected to remain subdued over 2017.
Consistent with this, wage growth is projected to remain modest in the near term, before
recovering further ahead.
3.1 Wages
The outlook for domestic cost pressures, and consequently
inflation (Section 4), will depend in part on how wages
develop. Over recent years, wage growth has remained below
past averages, with whole-economy pay growth likely to have
slowed to 2.3% in 2017 Q1 (Chart 3.1). That is weaker
than the 2.9% projected in the February Report and reflects
slower-than-projected growth in both regular pay and
bonuses. Wage growth can be volatile, however, so it is too
early to judge with certainty how persistent the recent slowing
is likely to be. While some survey indicators point to
continued subdued wage growth in the near term, others
suggest a pickup (Table 3.A).
Over time, a key determinant of wage growth is the pace of
productivity growth (Section 3.3). It can also be affected by
cyclical factors such as the degree of slack in the economy
(Section 3.2). One key indicator of slack is the unemployment
rate. While unemployment has continued to fall in recent
months (Chart 3.2), that has been accompanied by a rise in
inactivity in the labour market and so overall this may not
represent much of a reduction in slack. Employment growth
has remained subdued, although companies’ reported
employment intentions and the high level of vacancies suggest
it is likely to recover somewhat over 2017 (Section 3.2).
Wage growth has remained modest despite the steady fall
in the unemployment rate in recent years. In the February
Report, the MPC set out its judgement that subdued wage
growth was likely, in part, to reflect a lower equilibrium rate
of unemployment than in the past. This means that
unemployment may have to fall further before wage growth
and labour cost pressures return to more normal levels. In
addition, the relationship between slack and wage growth can
vary over time. For example, it is possible that some of the
recent weakness is a consequence of companies’ uncertainty
about the outlook, with some unwilling to raise wages at a
faster pace until they have more clarity about their future
costs and markets.

signalled by the index.
Section 3 Supply and the labour market 19
In the near term, wages may also be affected by the increase
in external costs facing companies as a result of the
depreciation in sterling since late 2015 (Section 4). Companies
may try to offset higher external cost growth by reducing
wage growth. In a survey by the Bank’s Agents in January,
companies, on balance, reported that limits in their ability to
pass on external cost increases to prices were expected to
dampen pay growth over 2017. Acting in the opposite
direction, however, households could become more active in
pushing for higher wage growth in response to the reduction in
their purchasing power, as companies pass through the rise in
external costs to higher consumer prices.
Alongside changes in external costs, increases in other labour
costs could push down wage growth slightly, as companies
may seek to limit growth in their overall labour costs.
Although small in terms of overall costs, the continued
phasing in of automatic enrolment in workplace pension
schemes is likely to push up non-wage labour costs. The
introduction of the Apprenticeship Levy may also lead to
higher staff-related costs for some companies.
Four-quarter wage growth is expected to fall a bit further in
Q2, as the higher rate of growth at the start of 2016 drops out
of the annual comparison. Further ahead, wage growth is
projected to rise, although it is likely to remain subdued given
modest productivity growth (Section 5).
3.2 Labour market developments
Labour demand
Changes in the demand outlook for goods and services tend to
be reflected in companies’ labour demand. Companies facing
higher output demand, for example, can adjust their labour
input either by increasing the size of their workforce or the
hours that their existing employees work. Increased demand
for labour should, in turn, give workers greater capacity to
demand higher wages.
Overall labour demand appears to have increased recently,
with total hours worked rising sharply. That largely reflected a
rise in the average number of hours worked per person. In the
three months to February, average hours worked rose to their
highest level since 2002, and are expected to have remained
around this level in Q1 as a whole (Chart 3.3). That is
markedly higher than anticipated in the February Report.
By contrast, growth in the number of people employed
remained somewhat subdued and much slower than in
2016 H1 (Table 3.B), although broadly in line with
expectations in February.
To some extent, the slowing in employment growth over the
past year is likely to reflect a continued normalisation in the
labour market as unemployment has fallen and recruitment
difficulties have returned to around past average levels

.
(Table 3.B). But some of that slowing may also reflect the
effects of heightened uncertainty and the anticipation of a
more subdued demand outlook following the vote to leave the
European Union.
Companies’ employment intentions softened following the
EU referendum last summer but have since recovered
somewhat (Chart 3.4). Moreover, the number of vacancies
— a key indicator of hiring — increased in Q1, while the
number of redundancies has drifted lower (Table 3.B).
Consistent with that, employment growth is projected to
recover somewhat in coming quarters, albeit remaining below
the very strong rates in 2013–15, when slack in the labour
market was being absorbed. Alongside that, average hours
worked are expected to fall back gradually (Table 3.C).
Labour supply and slack in the labour market
One influence on wage growth is the balance between labour
demand and labour supply, or the degree of slack in the labour
market. An important indicator of slack is the unemployment
rate, which fell to 4.7% in the three months to February
(Chart 3.2). This was a little lower than expected at the time
of the February Report. Within this, the long-term
unemployment rate, which has accounted for much of the
decline in overall unemployment in recent quarters, has now
fallen to around its pre-crisis average rate (Chart 3.5).
Shorter-term unemployment rates have remained broadly
stable, at a little below pre-crisis levels.
As set out in the box on pages 18–20 of the February Report,
the MPC judges that the equilibrium unemployment rate —
the rate to which unemployment needs to fall in order for
wage growth and labour cost pressures to be sufficient to keep
inflation at target — is likely to be around 4½%. However,
there remains significant uncertainty around the equilibrium
rate and there are a range of views among MPC members.
Bank staff estimate that the unemployment rate is likely to be
broadly stable in the near term (Chart 3.2), at close to its
equilibrium rate.
While unemployment represents those who are actively
looking for a job, on average just as many people move into
employment who had previously reported they were not
actively seeking work, such as students. As a result, changes
in inactivity may also affect the degree of slack in the labour
market. The fall in the unemployment rate in recent months
was accompanied by a rise in inactivity, such that the
participation rate — the proportion of people who report
they are actively looking for work — fell (Chart 3.6). As
such, participation is now judged to be slightly below its
equilibrium rate.
The equilibrium participation rate is projected to remain stable
in the near term, reflecting two large but broadly offsetting
factors. The rising average age of the population is likely to

Section 3 Supply and the labour market 21
weigh on aggregate participation in the workforce, as the
participation rate of older people is typically lower. Offsetting
this broad demographic drag, participation rates among older
people have increased steadily in recent years and this trend is
expected to continue. The profile for participation is subject
to risks in both directions, however, reflecting uncertainty over
the precise extent to which these factors offset each other.
Moreover, as discussed below, slowing real income growth
could also affect the participation rate in coming quarters.
The extent to which those in work contribute to labour supply
and the degree of slack in the labour market will also depend
on the hours they want to work — or the equilibrium level
of average hours. The recent increase in average hours
(Chart 3.3) has been associated with a fall in the proportion of
those employed working part-time (Chart 3.7). In addition,
the share of part-time employees reporting that they could
not find a full-time job fell. That suggests that the shift into
full-time work is likely to have come mainly from those
part-time workers that had already been looking to increase
their hours, rather than representing a further increase in the
number of hours people, on average, want to work. As such,
that shift is unlikely to be associated with an increase in labour
supply.
Beyond some near-term volatility associated with changes in
labour demand, the structural effect of an ageing workforce is
still expected to lead to a gradual decline in average hours
worked. As discussed in past Reports, the rising average age of
the workforce is likely to push down the equilibrium level in
coming years, reflecting the greater desire of older workers to
work part time.(1)
The weakness in real income growth and the associated
slowing in demand growth (Section 2) may influence labour
supply in the near term. Households could seek to mitigate
the reduction in their purchasing power from higher import
prices by supplementing their pay. This could be done either
by seeking to increase the hours they work, or by increasing
participation in the labour market, for example by another
member of the household joining the workforce. Acting in the
opposite direction, however, the lower returns to working
more, as a result of the fall in purchasing power, may
discourage some households from seeking additional work.
In the long run, growth in the supply of labour will be
determined mainly by population growth. Although
population growth leads to higher supply, it also contributes
to domestic demand. Changes in the path of population
growth are therefore unlikely to have much direct impact on
slack or, consequently, wage growth.(2)

22 Inflation Report May 2017
In the MPC’s projections, population growth is assumed to
evolve in line with the ONS’s latest projection, made in
October 2015. Under that projection, population growth
slows over the next three years, mainly as a result of lower
net immigration. In the four quarters to 2016 Q3, net inward
migration was around 273,000, or 0.4% of the population.
That flow is the lowest since 2014 Q2, but remains above the
ONS’s 2015 projection. The prospects for net migration
remain particularly uncertain, and will depend on a number of
factors, including the United Kingdom’s relative economic
performance, the sterling exchange rate and government
policy.
3.3 Productivity
The pace at which wages can grow in the long run without
generating excess inflation will depend on how productively
people and hours are put to use. Four-quarter hourly
productivity growth is expected to have fallen to 0.7% in
2017 Q1, having picked up sharply in the previous quarter
(Chart 3.8). This volatility partly reflects changes in average
hours worked. Productivity growth is expected to pick up in
coming quarters, as average hours fall back, but to remain at
subdued rates.
One factor that will influence the pace of productivity growth
is changes in the size of the capital stock — the resources and
equipment available to workers to produce output. Growth in
the size of the capital stock, relative to labour, is estimated to
have been subdued since 2011, reflecting weakness in
investment (Section 2). That limited growth in the capital
stock appears to have accounted for a large part of the
weakness in productivity growth over the recent past, relative
to its pre-crisis trend. Given this, a recovery in productivity
growth is in part likely to be reliant on a pickup in business
investment growth.
Investment in the capital stock and the extent to which
companies improve the efficiency with which labour and
capital are put to use — also known as total factor productivity
— are likely to be sensitive to the process of Brexit. The
United Kingdom has now formally confirmed its intention to
leave the European Union. The box on page 29 of the
August 2016 Report set out some of the long-term effects of
changes in trading arrangements on productivity growth. It
remains difficult to know the nature, scale and speed of
companies’ adjustment, both in anticipation of changes in
future trading arrangements and given the uncertainty around
those arrangements. Those uncertainties are likely to lead to
lower investment in capital equipment, research and skills
than would otherwise be the case, and so could weigh on
overall productivity growth, for a period at least.

Section 4 Costs and prices 23
4 Costs and prices
CPI inflation was 2.3% in March, having been below the 2% target over much of the past three
years. Inflation is expected to have risen further since then, reflecting the continued pass-through
of the past fall in the sterling exchange rate to consumer prices. The outlook for inflation will
depend on how firms respond to those rising imported costs given domestic cost pressures, the
strength of demand and inflation expectations. Inflation expectations have risen from recent lows
and are judged to be broadly consistent with the MPC’s 2% target.
4.1 Consumer price developments and the
near-term outlook
CPI inflation picked up to 2.3% in March, from 1.6% in
December (Chart 4.1). Inflation has been rising since late
2015, as the drag from the appreciation in sterling and fall in
global energy prices during 2014–15 has diminished, as the
effect of the 16% depreciation over the past 18 months has
started to come through and as commodity prices have risen.
Food and fuel prices are generally the most sensitive
components of the CPI to movements in the sterling exchange
rate; these goods are more easily traded and have a
higher-than-average import share. Consistent with this, the
effect of the past depreciation has been evident in the rising
contribution from fuel prices to inflation over recent months
(Chart 4.2). And, while at the time of the February Report
food price inflation had yet to pick up, it too is now starting to
rise.(1) Moreover, the prices of goods other than food and fuel
have also risen, as the effects of the depreciation have started
to be passed through more broadly. Inflation in March was
0.2 percentage points higher than projected in February due to
larger-than-expected contributions from a wide range of
goods.
CPI inflation is expected to rise further in Q2 (Chart 4.1), in
part driven by further rises in goods prices (Chart 4.2) as the
effects of the fall in sterling and rising foreign export prices
(Section 4.2) continue to feed through. In addition,
announced rises in utility prices are expected to contribute to
higher inflation in the near term.
The path for inflation in coming quarters will depend on the
speed and extent to which companies pass through rising
external costs to consumer prices, together with
developments in domestic cost pressures and demand
conditions (Section 4.3). Domestic cost pressures largely

reflect the cost of labour but can also be influenced by
companies’ and households’ inflation expectations, which can
affect wage and price-setting behaviour (Section 4.4).
4.2 Developments in the prices of traded
goods and services
The prices of goods and services that are traded globally —
such as food, energy and other imports — and the sterling
exchange rate have been the main drivers of the fall and
subsequent rise in inflation in recent years. Sterling has risen
by 2½% since the February Report, but remains 16% lower
than its peak in November 2015 (Section 1).
Energy prices
The cost of oil makes up around a third of the cost of retail
fuel and changes in oil prices tend to be passed through to
consumer prices much more quickly than those of other
imports. In sterling terms, oil prices have fallen by 8% since
the February Report (Chart 4.3) and have fallen further since
the MPC’s May projections were finalised. That mainly reflects
the fall in US dollar oil prices (Section 1), coupled with the
appreciation in sterling against the US dollar since February.
Despite this fall, sterling oil prices remain higher than a year
ago and petrol prices are therefore projected to continue to
push up annual CPI inflation over the coming months
(Chart 4.2), albeit to a slightly lesser extent than anticipated
in February.
Wholesale gas is a key input into the production of gas and
electricity supplied to households. In contrast to oil prices, the
pass-through of wholesale gas prices to retail prices is often
more variable and occurs with a lag, as domestic energy
companies tend to agree the purchase of future gas supplies
well in advance.
While the wholesale gas spot price has fallen sharply since the
February Report, gas prices remain around 30% higher than a
year ago (Chart 4.3). Moreover, UK energy companies have
reported that they face rising costs associated with structural
changes, such as the increased use of renewable energy
sources. Since February, five major retail energy providers
have announced increases in their electricity and gas prices.
These announcements mean that, on average, electricity
prices are expected to rise by 14% and gas prices by around
3% by the end of summer. These price increases are larger
and earlier than those anticipated in February. Therefore, by
September, electricity and gas prices are expected to push up
inflation by 0.2 percentage points more than previously
projected.
Non-energy import prices
The prices of UK goods and services will also be affected by
the cost of non-energy imports. These costs will depend both

exports and the sterling exchange rate. As explained in the
box on pages 28–29 of the November 2015 Report, Bank staff
estimated that, on average, 60% of changes in sterling world
export prices have tended to be reflected in UK import prices.
That pass-through is usually completed within a year. The
speed and extent of pass-through varies over time, however.(1)
There is some evidence to suggest that the pass-through of
the depreciation to import prices since late 2015 has been
more limited than on average in the past. World export prices
in sterling terms are estimated to have risen by 20% in the
year to 2016 Q4 (Table 4.A). While import price data can be
volatile and subject to large revisions, they have risen by only
around a third of the rise in sterling world export prices, less
than the 60% average pass-through over the past.
On the one hand, the limited response of import prices so far
could suggest that there is further pass-through from the fall
in sterling to come. It is possible that uncertainty about the
effect of Brexit on UK demand may have initially caused firms
selling to the United Kingdom to limit sterling price increases.
Moreover, given the higher-than-usual level of uncertainty
around the time of the referendum, some firms may have
hedged their near-term foreign currency exposures by more
than in the past, delaying the impact of the depreciation on
their prices. Companies may have also been unsure as to how
persistent the depreciation in sterling would prove to be.
Demand growth since the referendum has, however, been
stronger than projected by most forecasters. Alongside this,
the depreciation in sterling has largely persisted. Import prices
could therefore be expected to continue to rise in response.
On the other hand, there may be less pass-through to import
prices to come. Large movements in the exchange rate have
in the past tended to be passed through to import prices more
quickly than average. Moreover, following the 2013–15
appreciation in sterling, import prices fell by only around a
third of the change in sterling world export prices (Table 4.A).
The continuation of the pass-through from that appreciation
may have offset some of the pass-through from the
subsequent depreciation, implying there is little further to
come. Or the recent experience could simply suggest that the
effect of the exchange rate on import prices will be smaller on
this occasion than on average in the past.
Since February, sterling has appreciated by 2½%, but remains
16% below its November 2015 peak. That appreciation
implies a somewhat smaller overall rise in import prices still to
come. Import prices are expected to have risen by 8%
between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q1 and to rise by around ¾% a
quarter on average over the rest of 2017, slightly less than
projected in February (Table 4.B). There is a risk, however,

that given the limited extent of pass-through so far import
prices rise by less than that. The MPC will continue to monitor
closely the evolution of import prices.
4.3 Cost pressures and companies’ margins
The rises in import prices so far will have pushed up firms’
costs. This will have squeezed profit margins for
domestic-facing firms, though exporters’ profit margins will
have been supported by the depreciation in sterling
(Section 2). Margins on consumer goods and services
narrowed over 2016 (Chart 4.4). The outlook for CPI inflation
will depend on how long companies are able to absorb cost
increases in their margins, whether they limit growth in other
costs such as wages in response (Section 3), or whether they
choose to raise their prices.
Bank staff estimate that, on average over the past, changes in
import prices have typically passed through to CPI in line with
the import share, which is around a third. Pass-through is
estimated to take place gradually, with annual inflation still
being affected four years after the change in sterling. This
implies that while higher imported input costs may squeeze
margins for some quarters, these are restored over time.(1)
As discussed in the February Report, the MPC judges that,
given the nature of the recent fall in sterling, the speed of
pass-through from import prices to consumer prices is likely to
be faster than average. Consistent with that judgement, there
are signs that companies are passing cost increases through to
final prices quite quickly. Inflation among import-intensive
components of CPI — those components that are imported or
have a high share of imported inputs, such as food — has risen
in recent months (Chart 4.5).
Survey indicators suggest that growth in companies’ input
costs rose further in Q1 and input cost growth is expected to
continue to rise in the near term, placing further downward
pressure on many firms’ margins. In turn, that is likely to push
up inflation in coming quarters as firms rebuild their profit
margins. A range of output price indicators suggest that firms
expect their output price inflation to pick up further in the
near term (Chart 4.5), consistent with those margins being
rebuilt fairly rapidly. There is, however, uncertainty around
the extent of that upward pressure and businesses’ pricing
decisions will be affected by developments in domestic costs
and demand conditions.
Domestically generated inflation and unit labour costs
As discussed in the box on page 28, in addition to external
costs, domestically generated inflation (DGI) will also
contribute to the rate of CPI inflation. The rate of DGI
consistent with inflation returning to the 2% target, however,

(a) Calculated as differences in the ratio of the CPI, seasonally adjusted by Bank staff, and

Input-Output Analytical Tables 2010, adjusted to reflect the composition of CPI. Where
applicable, the weights capture each factor’s contribution to all stages of the domestic
production process.
Section 4 Costs and prices 27
will depend on the long-run trend in those external costs.
While the pass-through of sharp changes in the exchange rate
is transitory, long-run trends in import price inflation may
affect CPI inflation more persistently. If, for example, sterling
world export price inflation were to be persistently higher than
in the past then the rate of DGI consistent with inflation at
target would be commensurately lower.
The cost of labour, such as wages and other non-wage
benefits, forms around half of firms’ input costs. It is therefore
a key determinant of DGI. The degree to which growth in
labour costs affects inflation depends on how it evolves
relative to growth in output produced per worker — known as
unit labour cost growth.
The weakness in wage growth over recent years has occurred
alongside relatively modest productivity growth (Section 3),
so unit labour cost pressures within companies have not been
as weak (Chart 4.6). While unit labour cost growth is
expected to have been relatively stable at around 2% in
2017 Q1, it is projected to ease in coming quarters, reflecting
modest wage growth coupled with a slight pickup in
productivity growth.
4.4 Inflation expectations
Inflation expectations can also affect the outlook for inflation,
such as through their influence on wage and price-setting
behaviour. The MPC monitors a range of indicators to assess
whether inflation expectations remain consistent with its 2%
target.
Indicators of inflation expectations do not all map directly into
CPI inflation. This is because many surveys do not specify
exactly which measure of inflation they are asking households
about. In addition, market-based measures tend to reference
RPI inflation and will reflect changes in the risks around future
inflation as well as central expectations. One way to judge the
appropriate level of expectations is therefore to compare them
to past averages (Table 4.C).
Short-term measures of inflation expectations have picked up
in recent quarters (Table 4.C). While some are above their
past averages, short-term expectations would be expected to
respond to the rising near-term outlook for inflation. Among
households responding to the 2017 Q1 Bank/TNS Inflation
Attitudes survey, those with rising inflation expectations
attributed this to their view of the outlook for economic
conditions, the level of sterling and the current strength of the
UK economy.
Measures of households’ longer-term expectations have also
increased slightly, but are close to past average levels, having
been subdued in recent years. Financial market measures of
long-term inflation expectations have declined since February,

28 Inflation Report May 2017
Measures of domestically generated inflation
Domestic inflationary pressures are an important component
of the outlook for headline inflation. These will influence
where CPI inflation settles when transitory effects, such as
those from the recent fall in sterling, have passed through. It
is, therefore, important to monitor domestic costs and profit
margins, or ‘domestically generated inflation’ (DGI). While
DGI is not directly observable, there are measures that are
closely linked to the concept of DGI. These fall broadly into
three groups: the price of services; the price of domestically
produced output; and labour costs. This box summarises the
strengths and weaknesses of different measures and their
recent developments.
As most services are provided domestically, their prices can be
used as one indicator of DGI. The two main measures of
services prices used are wholesale services prices, as measured
by the services producer price index (PPI), and the price of
consumer services excluding those components that are more
likely to be related to tradable prices, such as airfares and
package holidays. However, these types of measures suffer
from the shortcoming that they do not capture the prices of
domestically produced elements of goods. Moreover, the PPI
measure will include not just services provided domestically
but also those to exporters and importers.
A second approach to measuring DGI is through measures of
the price of domestic production. One such measure is the
GDP deflator. However, the GDP deflator includes the
government sector, which is less relevant for CPI. An
alternative measure is the GVA deflator excluding government
output. These deflator-based measures of DGI are helpful
guides, but they can still be affected by external cost pressures
to the extent that they reflect both labour inputs into and the
margins on exported goods and services.
A third group of indicators of DGI focuses on labour costs.
Labour is the largest domestic input into consumer goods and
services. Therefore, unit labour costs (ULCs) are an important
measure of DGI (Section 4.3). The MPC monitors ULCs
together with unit wage costs (UWCs), as ULCs can be
affected by volatile non-wage labour costs, such as pension
contributions. Both measures, however, rely on estimates of
productivity growth, which can also be quite volatile.
ULCs and UWCs provide information on all labour costs not
just those used to produce domestically consumed goods and
services. To the extent that the cost of labour inputs used to
produce domestically consumed products grows at a different
pace to those for exports, these measures may capture cost
pressures beyond DGI. Any difference is, however, likely to be
smaller than that between the margins on exported and
domestically consumed products reflected in the GDP
deflator.
As the various measures of DGI all have strengths and
weaknesses, it is helpful to monitor a range of measures to
judge the extent of domestic inflationary pressures. Over
recent quarters, measures of labour costs (the pink series in
Chart A) and prices in the services sector (the blue series)
suggest that DGI has been fairly steady. In contrast, measures
based on the GDP deflator (the beige series) have picked up.
This may partly reflect a pickup in exporters’ margins
(Section 2) following the depreciation in sterling. There are a
range of views among MPC members about the relative
importance of various measures of DGI, however, and some
members also consider other measures.

and are also close to past average levels (Section 1). And
professional forecasters continue to expect inflation to be
close to the target in two to three years’ time.
Overall, the MPC judges that inflation expectations remain
well anchored, and that indicators of medium-term inflation
expectations continue to be broadly consistent with the 2%
target. The MPC will continue to monitor measures of
inflation expectations closely.
Section 5 Prospects for inflation 29
5 Prospects for inflation
Inflation has risen above the 2% target as the falls in the sterling exchange rate since late 2015 have
begun to feed through to consumer prices. Quarterly GDP growth has slowed, in part reflecting the
impact of lower real income growth on household consumption. Through its effects on costs, the fall
in sterling is likely to keep inflation above the 2% target throughout the next three years. Where
inflation settles once that upward pressure fades will depend on domestic price pressures.
Conditional on current market interest rates, which suggest only one 25 basis point rate rise over the
next three years, those domestic cost pressures are judged likely to be building towards the end of the
forecast period.
CPI inflation has risen above the MPC’s 2% target as the fall in
sterling has begun to feed through to consumer prices. Wage
growth remains subdued. Household consumption growth
appears to be slowing in response to the resultant weakness in
real income growth. Reflecting that, UK GDP growth slowed to
0.3% in Q1, according to the preliminary estimate, a slightly
sharper slowdown than expected three months ago. Set against
that downside news, the latest indicators suggest broad-based
momentum in global activity, and a rise in investment intentions
among UK companies.
The outlook for UK growth will continue to be influenced by the
response of households, companies and financial market
participants to the prospect of the United Kingdom’s departure
from the European Union, including their assumptions about the
nature and timing of post-Brexit trading arrangements. The
projections in this Report continue to be conditioned on the
average of a range of possible outcomes for those arrangements
and, as before, the assumption that the adjustment to the United
Kingdom’s new relationship with the European Union is smooth.
Sterling has appreciated by 2½% since the February Report, with
a sharp move on the day that the UK election was announced,
possibly reflecting an increase in the probability that market
participants are attaching to a smooth, rather than disorderly,
Brexit process. The sterling ERI remains 16% below its
November 2015 peak, however. UK market interest rates have
fallen. Given those falls, the projections in this Report,
summarised in Table 5.A, are conditioned on a path for
Bank Rate that rises to just ½% by mid-2020, around
20 basis points lower than in the February Report (Table 5.B).(1)
(1) Unless otherwise stated, the projections shown in this section are conditioned on:
Bank Rate following a path implied by market yields; the stock of purchased gilts
remaining at £435 billion and the stock of purchased corporate bonds remaining at
£10 billion throughout the forecast period and the Term Funding Scheme (TFS), all three
of which are financed by the issuance of central bank reserves; the Recommendations of
the Financial Policy Committee and the current regulatory plans of the Prudential
Regulation Authority; the Government’s tax and spending plans as set out in the
2017 March Budget; commodity prices following market paths; and the sterling exchange
rate remaining broadly flat. The main assumptions are set out in a table at

30 Inflation Report May 2017
In the MPC’s central projection, four-quarter GDP growth
slows over 2017, as quarterly growth remains close to the Q1
rate. Within that, a slowing in consumption growth is largely
balanced by rising net trade and investment, which provide
more support to activity than in the recent past.
Household consumption growth seems to be slowing in
response to the weak real income growth associated with the
lower level of sterling. That adjustment continues over the
forecast period with growth in both income and consumption
remaining below past averages (Key Judgement 1).
The depreciation in the exchange rate, together with a
further pickup in global demand growth, is likely to support
exports and weigh on imports such that net trade contributes
positively to growth for much of the forecast period
(Key Judgement 2). Expectations of changes in the
United Kingdom’s trading arrangements are, however,
increasingly likely to influence UK exports and imports over
the forecast period.
Companies’ investment decisions depend on their view of
likely future demand for their products. The latest investment
surveys suggest some recovery in investment growth this year,
after falls last year. Exporters in particular may raise
investment in the near term to help meet demand from
abroad. But persistent uncertainty about the outlook for
demand is projected to weigh on longer-term investment
plans to some degree (Key Judgement 3). That is associated
with continued subdued growth in the capital stock, and hence
productivity.
Higher import prices are projected to lead to a further rise
in CPI inflation this year, such that it reaches 2.8% in Q4
(Chart 5.1) (Key Judgement 4). The impetus from import

Charts 5.1 and 5.2 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future. They have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b). If economic circumstances identical to today’s
were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan charts are constructed
so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the
fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey
background. See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

prices is likely to fade only gradually throughout the forecast
period. Its projected contribution to inflation at the three-year
horizon is just over ¼ percentage point, smaller than in
February following the 2½% appreciation of sterling since
then.
Where CPI inflation settles once the boost to inflation from
higher import prices has receded will depend on domestic cost
pressures. Weakness in productivity growth and a continuing
drag from slack are two factors that have been weighing on
wage growth over recent years. Domestic inflationary
pressures are likely to remain subdued in the near term.
Nonetheless, with unemployment falling towards its
equilibrium rate, wage growth is expected to rise over time
and that is associated with a further pickup in domestically
generated inflation from the low rates seen in recent years.
Conditional on the path for Bank Rate based on market yields
and an unchanged stock of purchased assets, GDP grows at
around 1¾% in the second and third years of the forecast
period (Chart 5.3). That demand growth is slightly above
potential so that unemployment falls (Chart 5.4) and the
small output gap at the start of the forecast period narrows
through the forecast period and closes by the end. That is
associated with building domestic price pressures such that
inflation is projected to be rising in the third year of the
projection even as the impact of imported price pressures
fades. That rise in domestic pressure is greater than assumed
three months ago, reflecting the stronger path for world
growth, support from the lower yield curve and the modest
fiscal loosening in the March Budget. Overall, inflation is
judged more likely to remain above the 2% target than fall
below it throughout the forecast period (Chart 5.5).
At its meeting ending on 10 May 2017, the MPC voted to
maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%, to maintain the stock of sterling
non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion
and to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at
£435 billion. The factors behind that decision are set out in
the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and
in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.(1) The remainder
of this section sets out the MPC’s projections, and the risks
around them, in more detail.
5.1 The MPC’s key judgements and risks
Key Judgement 1: higher import prices weigh on real
incomes and household consumption growth
The depreciation in sterling since late 2015 has raised import
prices. That is beginning to feed through to consumer prices

Chart 5.3 GDP projection based on market interest rate
expectations, other policy measures as announced
The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b). To the left of the vertical dashed line,
the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past; to the right, it
reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future. If economic circumstances
identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that
the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of
those occasions. The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within
each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast
period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of
100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere
outside the green area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the
light grey background. See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a

Chart 5.4 Unemployment projection based on market

The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b). The coloured bands have the same
interpretation as in Chart 5.1, and portray 90% of the probability distribution. The calibration of
this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example,
it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on
unemployment in successive quarters. The fan begins in 2017 Q1, a quarter earlier than the fan
for CPI inflation. That is because Q1 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in
part on data for January and February. The unemployment rate was 4.7% in the three months to
February, and is projected to be 4.7% in Q1 as a whole. A significant proportion of this
distribution lies below Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment
rate. There is therefore uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart.
32 Inflation Report May 2017
(Key Judgement 4) and is associated with particularly weak
real income growth for households this year. Further ahead,
annual real income growth recovers somewhat as real wage
growth picks up. But with modest growth in employment and
the continuing drag from the fiscal consolidation, it remains
well below past average rates (Table 5.C).
The MPC has been expecting household consumption growth
to slow in response to the renewed weakening in real income
growth, but there was uncertainty about how quickly that
would happen. The latest data show signs of consumers
beginning to adjust. Retail sales fell sharply in Q1. House
price inflation has slowed and housing transactions have
grown only sluggishly. It appears likely that consumption
growth began to slow at the start of this year, with that
adjustment somewhat sharper than had been expected in
February (Section 2).
There remains uncertainty over how persistent the weakness
in household consumption will be. Some indicators, including
consumer confidence, have held up in recent months. It is
possible that consumption growth could bounce back a little,
especially if households take advantage of relatively low
borrowing costs to smooth through the current period of weak
income growth. Although there is some early evidence the
terms of consumer credit may be tightening, credit conditions
are still accommodative by historical standards. It is also
possible that consumption growth weakens further, however,
for example if households’ concerns about the outlook for the
economy, and their own job security, rise.
On balance, the MPC judges that four-quarter consumption
growth is likely to slow further over 2017 before picking up to
just over 1½% towards the end of the forecast period. The
slowdown is more marked than in February in the near term
but, given that quicker adjustment, the recovery is
correspondingly stronger such that the projected level of
consumption in mid-2020 is little changed. That outlook is
consistent with some slowing in consumer credit growth from
current high rates. House price inflation picks up again,
reaching annual rates of around 4% later in the forecast
period. Housing investment is expected to continue to grow
at below past average rates over the forecast period as a
whole (Table 5.C).
The projections for income and spending imply a slight fall in
the saving ratio over the forecast period. But, as set out in the
box on pages 16–17, recent changes in the saving ratio (and
hence its level over the forecast period) may offer a less useful
signal about household finances than usual. The ONS expects
to revise up materially the past rate of saving later this year.
Moreover, the sharp fall in 2016 reflected declines in
non-labour income, including that in pension funds, which
probably have few implications for current spending.

Key Judgement 2: UK trade will be supported by the past
depreciation of the sterling exchange rate and the expected
pickup in global growth
Global momentum is likely to support aggregate demand
growth while UK consumption growth remains subdued. The
latest indicators, including trade growth and capital goods
orders, suggest broad-based strength in global activity,
although that strength has yet to be fully reflected in official
estimates of GDP growth. Nonetheless, signs of more robust
global demand have been reflected in global asset prices, with
equity prices rising further.
Table 5.D Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements
The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key
judgements. Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will
monitor a broad range of variables to understand the degree
to which the risks are crystallising. The table below shows
Bank staff’s indicative near-term projections that are
consistent with the judgements in the MPC’s central view
evolving as expected.

34 Inflation Report May 2017
Euro-area GDP growth was 0.5% in 2017 Q1, a little above its
average of 0.4% per quarter in recent years. Survey indicators
point to a further pickup in growth in Q2. That higher growth
in the first half of this year reflects support from monetary
policy and the impacts of improving credit conditions and
waning uncertainty. With the recovery now appearing more
entrenched, the Committee has assumed a little more
persistence in euro-area growth than in the February
projections (Table 5.E). The recovery to date has been
associated with some erosion of slack, which continues over
the forecast period. Core inflation therefore picks up
gradually.
In the United States, survey indicators continue to point to
robust growth rates. The Q1 GDP growth data were weaker
than those indicators at 0.2%. But that reflects a drag from
inventories and a dip in consumption growth. Both of these
effects are likely to unwind in Q2 (Section 1). Investment
growth, by contrast, was strong. Unlike the euro area, the
United States has had a period of sufficiently robust growth to
use up much of its spare capacity, with unemployment back to
its pre-crisis level. US GDP growth is nonetheless projected to
pick up a little into 2018 (Table 5.E) in part reflecting the
support from fiscal policy — although uncertainty remains
about its precise composition, timing and scale. Conditioned
on market yields, which imply a rise in the federal funds rate
to 1¾% by early 2020, GDP growth is then expected to fall
back towards a modest rate of supply growth, consistent with
subdued productivity growth and less support from
demographic trends than in the past.
In China, growth is continuing at a robust pace, with an
accompanying strong expansion in credit. Rises in interest
rates and macroprudential measures have been associated
with a slowing in house price inflation, but a significant
downside risk remains of a sharper adjustment in the property
market or credit markets more broadly. In the central
projection, a sharp adjustment is avoided and growth slows
gradually over the forecast period.
Weighted by UK export shares, world GDP growth is projected
to average around 2½% over the forecast period (Chart 5.6),
up from 2% in 2016, with PPP-weighted growth at or a little
above 3½%. That is associated with average consumer price
inflation around the world at just over 2%, higher than rates
seen in recent years. The projection for world growth is a little
stronger than in February but the risks around the projection
remain skewed to the downside.
That rise in global growth is one factor supporting UK net
trade. Exporters will also benefit from the 16% fall in sterling
from its November 2015 peak, which is likely to weigh on
import growth. Surveys and the Bank’s Agents’ contacts
suggest that export growth has indeed strengthened and is
likely to pick up further in the near term. Over time, it is likely

that companies will make some changes to their operations in
light of Brexit, which are projected to weigh on both exports
and imports at least temporarily. Overall, net trade is
projected to support growth over the forecast period, as in
February. Although the recent rise in sterling reduces that
support a little, that effect is offset by the slightly stronger
global backdrop. The current account deficit is assumed to
end the forecast at around 3% of GDP. That compares with
its average of 4½% in recent years in the current vintage of
data (Section 2).
Key Judgement 3: investment and productivity growth
pick up but remain below longer-term average rates
Uncertainty around both global growth and the
EU referendum help explain why UK investment softened in
2016 despite favourable financing conditions. Recent
investment surveys, however, point to a rise in investment
intentions in 2017. In part that may reflect a desire to renew
and increase capacity by exporters benefiting from lower
sterling and stronger world demand. Uncertainty about the
outlook in light of Brexit is likely to weigh on longer-term
investment plans, however, and investment growth is
projected to fall back a little towards the end of the forecast
period (Table 5.C).
Given the sustained period of low investment growth since the
financial crisis, its level over the forecast period remains too
low to boost capital stock growth from its current subdued
rate. Capital stock growth has slowed to around 2½%,
compared with rates of around 3¾% prior to the crisis. This is
one factor that has weighed on productivity growth over the
recent past and will continue to do so.
Productivity is also influenced by companies’ expectations
about Brexit. For example, if trading arrangements are less
open, for a period at least, that is likely to require a gradual
reorientation of business models, which will weigh a little on
productivity growth. Overall, productivity grows at a subdued
pace throughout the forecast period, although growth picks up
relative to rates seen in recent years. The prospective growth
in underlying productivity, abstracting from cyclical effects, is
broadly similar to that in February. Actual hourly productivity
growth is weaker this year, however, reflecting recent rapid
growth in hours worked, but stronger further out as average
hours worked are projected to fall back gradually (Table 5.E).
At the start of the forecast period, the lower level of demand
is assumed to be matched by a lower level of supply such that
slack is the same as assumed in February. From the middle of
the forecast period, GDP is projected to grow slightly faster
than supply such that the unemployment rate falls to its
assumed equilibrium of 4.5% and slack closes. That is a
greater narrowing in slack than in February, reflecting slightly
stronger growth in the second half of the forecast period.

36 Inflation Report May 2017
Key Judgement 4: in the second half of the forecast period,
upward pressures on inflation from import prices diminish
and pressures from domestic costs build
Weak productivity growth and the level of slack have been
bearing down on UK wage growth in recent years. A gradual
recovery in wage growth has been expected for some time as
unemployment has fallen back towards pre-crisis lows and
productivity growth has risen, albeit slowly. But annual wage
growth fell back again around the turn of the year. The impact
of weak wage pressures on inflation have, however, been more
than offset by rising external pressures following the sharp
decline in sterling. CPI inflation rose to 2.3% in March, with
February’s outturn the first above the 2% target since 2013.
External cost pressures are a key influence on the shape of the
CPI inflation projection. By itself, the decline in sterling since
late 2015 would suggest an increase in UK import prices of
around 12% by the end of 2016, according to their past
average relationship (Section 4). Although import prices have
picked up, they have not yet risen to that extent, so further
increases are expected over the forecast period (Chart 5.7).
There is a risk that that does not come through, for example if
foreign exporters believe that it will be difficult to raise prices
in UK markets or if the preceding rise in sterling in 2013–15
had left their margins unusually high. In that event the
external impetus to inflation would be smaller.
There is further uncertainty about the eventual impact of
higher import prices on retail prices. In the central projection,
a given rise in non-energy import prices is assumed to lead to
a rise in average consumer prices of around a third of that size
over a number of years. As in recent Reports, given the size of
the decline in sterling, the MPC has continued to assume that
pass-through to CPI inflation will be a little quicker than on
average in the past. The latest data seem to support that
assumption (Section 4). The peak impact of import prices on
inflation is therefore projected to occur around mid-2018 at
just over ¾ percentage point, with that contribution then
tailing off but still positive at just over ¼ percentage point in
mid-2020. That contribution is lower than three months ago,
reflecting sterling’s appreciation since then.
Where CPI inflation settles once external cost pressures have
passed through will depend on domestic cost pressures. A
variety of indicators of domestically generated inflation have
picked up from their lows in recent years (see the box on
page 28). The recent fall in wage growth could simply reflect
volatility in the data. It is, however, possible that it is a
consequence of companies’ uncertainty about the outlook,
with some unwilling to raise wages at a faster pace until they
have more clarity about their future costs and markets. It is
also possible that rises in firms’ other labour costs — for
example, pension costs or the Apprenticeship Levy — are, to
some degree, bearing down on wages. These influences are
judged unlikely to persist throughout the forecast period.

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 37
With unemployment very close to its equilibrium rate,
four-quarter wage growth is expected to rise over time. But
given the subdued outlook for productivity growth, wage
growth is likely to remain below pre-crisis average rates.
Conditional on a path for Bank Rate that has only one
25 basis point rate rise towards the end of the forecast period,
unit labour cost growth is projected to build to around 3%
(Chart 5.8). Were rates to follow that path, the output gap is
projected to close, and the drag on inflation from slack to
dissipate, by the end of the forecast period. That would
increase the risk that inflation remains somewhat above the
2% target beyond the forecast horizon, even once the impact
of higher import prices has fully passed through. That risk
would be greater if inflation expectations were to respond to
the rise in headline inflation. On the downside, however, it is
possible that whatever has held wage growth down recently
persists for longer and inflation falls below the 2% target once
those external pressures have receded.
5.2 The projections for demand,
unemployment and inflation
Based on these judgements and the risks around them, and
under the path for Bank Rate based on market yields and an
unchanged stock of purchased assets, the MPC judges that
four-quarter growth will slow over 2017, settling around 1¾%
(Chart 5.3). That slowdown is led by weakening consumer
spending growth. Export growth is supported by a continued
expansion in overseas demand and the past falls in the
exchange rate. And investment growth recovers somewhat
after a weak 2016. GDP growth is a little weaker in the near
term than the projection three months ago, reflecting
downside news on output and consumption at the start of
2017. Further out, growth is a touch higher (Chart 5.9),
reflecting a stronger path for world growth, support from the
lower yield curve and the modest fiscal loosening in the
March Budget. The risks to the growth outlook remain skewed
to the downside further out (Table 5.F), stemming from
downside risks to the global outlook.
CPI inflation is projected to rise to only a little below 3% this
year, as higher import prices continue to be passed through to
consumer prices. The contribution of import prices falls back
over the forecast period but they are expected still to be
pushing inflation above the 2% target at the end, albeit by less
than three months ago given the appreciation of sterling
(Table 5.G). Conditional on the market path for Bank Rate,
demand grows slightly faster than supply in the second half of
the forecast period, unemployment falls and the output gap
closes by the end of the forecast period. That is associated
with building domestic price pressures such that inflation is
projected to be rising in the third year of the projection even
as external price pressures fade. Those domestic pressures are
projected to build a little more than three months ago,

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 39
How has the economy evolved relative to the
August 2016 Report?
The MPC regularly assesses how the economy has evolved
relative to its forecasts. This box looks at how recent
developments in GDP growth, the labour market and inflation
compare to the projections in the August 2016 Report, and
what the MPC has learnt from the evolution of the economy
over that period. The final section also assesses outturns
relative to the MPC’s fan charts over a longer period of time.
The August 2016 Report forecast
In the August Report, conditioned on the MPC’s policy
package,(1) GDP growth was projected to slow markedly over
the second half of 2016, and to remain subdued during 2017
(Chart A). While the Report noted that the implications of the
vote to leave the European Union would take time to unfold,
uncertainty around the United Kingdom’s future trading
arrangements was expected to weigh on spending growth in
the near term. Survey indicators of output, alongside other
indicators associated with property markets and uncertainty,
pointed to an immediate sharp slowing in growth and in some
cases a contraction in output. The MPC’s projection aimed off
that mechanical steer, judging that GDP growth would slow
but to a somewhat lesser extent. Other forecasters on
average expected growth to be slightly below the MPC’s
central projection at the time.(2)
The sharp fall in sterling, to 10% below the assumption
underpinning the May 2016 forecasts, was projected to feed
through to higher import prices and to take CPI inflation
temporarily above the 2% target over the second half of the
forecast period. Households’ purchasing power was expected
to be squeezed as a result, weighing on consumer spending
growth, although the fall in sterling was expected to support
exports. The projected slowing in GDP growth was expected
to be associated with a modest rise in unemployment, as
employers delayed hiring plans, and subdued wage growth.
GDP growth has risen and has therefore been stronger
than expected in August
Taking into account an expected 0.1 percentage point upward
revision to the ONS data, captured in the MPC’s backcast,
four-quarter GDP growth is estimated to have picked up to
2.2% in 2017 Q1 (Chart A). That is 1.2 percentage points
stronger than the August central projection.
Surveys and other indicators of output, uncertainty and
property markets, which had all pointed to an immediate
sharp slowing in growth, began to recover following the
August Report. And while the MPC’s forecast had aimed above
the output surveys, that recovery was particularly steep. That
was perhaps in part due to an improvement in business
sentiment, with the MPC’s August policy package one factor
potentially supporting that.
Private sector demand growth has been robust
The stronger-than-expected GDP outturn can be more than
explained by stronger private domestic demand growth. In
August, a slowing in real income growth had been expected to
lead to a gradual slowing in household consumption growth,
with the saving ratio falling only slightly in the near term. Real
income growth has actually been below the August forecast,
but consumption growth has been above expectations,
supported by a sharper fall in the saving ratio (Table 1) —
despite the slowing in consumption growth in 2017 Q1
(Section 2). Business and housing investment growth have
also surprised on the upside, although they have remained
weak in absolute terms.
One underlying factor explaining stronger-than-expected
demand growth may be that uncertainty has been less of a
drag on activity than anticipated, particularly for consumer
spending. Greater uncertainty can deter households from
making some major purchases and reduce companies’ appetite
for investment. Some of the weakness in investment does
appear to reflect a drag from uncertainty (Section 2), but a
smaller one than had been anticipated in August.
In addition, global and domestic financial conditions have
improved. While global growth has been only a touch
stronger than expected, improved sentiment around the
prospects for future activity growth appear to have led to rises

in many financial asset prices, in particular risky asset prices
(Section 1). That will have supported spending, both through
the effect of higher wealth and a lower cost of market-based
finance. Credit conditions facing households have also eased,
in part reflecting falls in bank funding costs. Lower uncertainty
and the improvement in credit conditions will have also
supported housing and commercial property prices, which
have been firmer than anticipated in August.
Despite an improvement in global conditions, net trade has
continued to drag on four-quarter GDP growth, rather than
providing a boost as expected. Unanticipated strength in
imports has more than outweighed stronger-than-expected
export growth. Although the contribution of net trade
volumes to GDP growth has been weaker, the trade deficit
— the nominal value of imports minus exports — has been
smaller than expected. That difference largely reflects an
improvement in the terms of trade relative to expectations,
with export prices having risen by more than import prices.
And coupled with higher-than-projected net investment
income — in part reflecting revisions to the past — the current
account deficit is currently estimated to be narrower than
projected in August (Table 1).
There appears to have been greater supply capacity
In August, the unemployment rate had been expected to edge
higher as employment growth stalled, but has instead
continued to drift down to 4.7% in early 2017 (Chart B).
Despite that, wage growth has remained subdued. At 2.3% in
the three months to February, annual wage growth was below
the August forecast for 2017 Q1 of around 3%. Following the
MPC’s regular assessment of aggregate supply-side conditions,
set out in the February Report, the MPC now judges that the
equilibrium unemployment rate, consistent with inflation at
target, is likely to have fallen to around 4½% from a pre-crisis
equilibrium rate that was probably around 5%. In part, that
judgement reflects the signal from continued weakness in
wage growth. It means that despite the further decline in
unemployment, a little slack is judged to remain within the
labour market.
The upside news in employment has, however, been smaller
than the news in GDP. Accordingly, growth in output per
worker has been stronger than expected in recent quarters.
That strength was initially reflected in stronger hourly
productivity growth, which appears to have since unwound
(Table 1). More recently, average hours worked have picked
up sharply (Section 3), rather than falling slightly as had been
anticipated in August.
Higher energy and utility prices pushed inflation up,
while sterling depreciated further
CPI inflation was broadly in line with the August forecast over
2016 H2, but was 0.5 percentage points higher than expected
in 2017 Q1 at 2.1% (Chart C). Higher-than-assumed fuels and
household energy prices can account for 0.3 percentage points
of the recent upside surprise in inflation. In particular, in
2017 Q1 US dollar oil prices were 9% higher than implied by
the market futures curve in August, on which the MPC’s
forecasts were conditioned (Table 1). Utilities prices had been

assumed to be broadly flat, but they have risen slightly and are
expected to rise further in coming months (Section 4).
Consumer prices will have also been affected by the
substantial fall in the exchange rate since late 2015. Between
the August Report and 2017 Q1, sterling depreciated further
(Table 1). Given the nature of the overall fall in sterling, in
November the MPC judged that sterling pass-through to
inflation would be a little faster than during past episodes and
hence the August forecast assumption. Given the time it takes
for exchange rate moves to be fully reflected in consumer
prices, it is too early to judge the overall degree and speed of
the pass-through from this episode. But pass-through from
import prices to consumer prices so far does indeed appear to
have been roughly in line with the judgement made in
November (Section 4).
With wage growth weaker than expected (Table 1) and growth
in output per worker stronger than expected, labour cost
pressures were somewhat more subdued than in the August
projection.
Implications for the MPC’s projections
Overall, while demand growth has been firmer than expected,
the faster pickup in inflation to date appears to have reflected
greater external cost pressures, including the effects of the
further fall in sterling, rather than additional domestic cost
pressures.
Looking ahead, the outlook for activity remains sensitive
to the eventual trading arrangements between the
United Kingdom and its economic partners. It remains too
early, however, to be able to assess the longer-term supply
implications of the United Kingdom’s departure from the
European Union.
Outturns relative to the MPC’s fan charts
One way of assessing the significance of economic news is by
comparing outturns against the MPC’s fan charts over time.
The 2017 Q1 GDP growth outturn was towards the higher end
of the August fan chart (Charts A and D), and inflation slightly
above its central band (Charts C and E). Given the inherent
uncertainty in forecasting, such outcomes are to be expected
on occasion. Indeed, if the fan charts accurately describe the
uncertainty faced by the MPC, then over time outturns would
be expected to lie evenly across the fan chart distribution, with
10% of outcomes in each decile. In absolute terms, therefore,
a growth forecast error as large as or larger than in August
2016 would be expected to occur almost 40% of the time.

Other forecasters’ expectations
This box reports the results of the Bank’s most recent survey
of external forecasters, carried out in April.(1) On average,
respondents expected four-quarter GDP growth to slow over
the coming year, before picking up towards 2% three years
ahead (Table 1). While growth projections have, on average,
been revised up since February, they remain below forecasts
produced a year ago, prior to the referendum (Chart A).
External forecasters’ central expectations for CPI inflation
were, on average, broadly unchanged from three months ago.
On average, external forecasters thought there was a
two-thirds probability of inflation being at or above the
2% target in two years’ time (Chart B). That is similar to
those projections in February, although within that the weight
placed on inflation being at or above 2.5% at that horizon had
fallen slightly.
Although the market-implied path for Bank Rate has flattened
since February (Section 1), external forecasters’ expectations
have risen slightly (Chart C). Respondents, on average,
projected Bank Rate to rise to 0.9% by 2020 Q2. Almost all
forecasters expected the current stocks of gilt and corporate
bond purchases, at £435 billion and £10 billion respectively, to
be maintained over the next three years.
