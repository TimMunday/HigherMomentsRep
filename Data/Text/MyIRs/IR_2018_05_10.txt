Inflation Report
May 2018
In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.
Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy,
including its objectives for growth and employment.
The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of
the Monetary Policy Committee. It serves two purposes. First, its preparation provides a
comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid
to our decision-making. Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the
reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect.
Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are
based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths
for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central
projections.
This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with
section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Inflation Report May 2018 Monetary Policy Summary i
Monetary Policy Summary
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet
the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.
At its meeting ending on 9 May 2018, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to maintain
Bank Rate at 0.5%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling
non‑financial investment‑grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of
central bank reserves, at £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to
maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of
central bank reserves, at £435 billion.
The MPC’s updated projections for inflation and activity are set out in the May Inflation Report. The outlook and
the main factors shaping it are broadly similar to those set out in the previous Report.
The preliminary estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter was 0.1%, 0.3 percentage points lower than expected
in February. This is likely in part to have reflected adverse weather in late February and early March. Survey
indicators suggest that growth was somewhat stronger in Q1 than implied by the preliminary estimate.
Despite the near‑term softness, the MPC’s central forecast for economic activity is little changed from that in the
previous Report. In the MPC’s central forecast, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by
current market yields, GDP is expected to grow by around 1¾% per year on average over the forecast period.
On the expenditure side, growth continues to rotate towards net trade and business investment and away from
consumption. Although business investment is still restrained by Brexit‑related uncertainties, it is being supported,
like exports, by strong global demand and accommodative financial conditions. Household consumption growth
remains subdued, in line with the modest growth in real income over the forecast period.
Wage growth and domestic cost pressures are firming gradually, broadly as expected. The MPC continues to judge
that the UK economy has a very limited degree of slack. Hiring intentions have remained strong and, over the past
three months, the unemployment rate has fallen slightly further. While modest by historical standards, the
projected pace of GDP growth over the forecast is nonetheless slightly faster than the diminished rate of supply
growth, which averages around 1½% per year. In the MPC’s central projection, therefore, a small margin of excess
demand still emerges by early 2020, feeding through into higher rates of pay growth and domestic cost pressures.
CPI inflation fell to 2.5% in March, lower than expected at the time of the February Report. The inflation rates of
the most import‑intensive components of the CPI appear to have peaked. The MPC judges that the impact of the
past depreciation of sterling on CPI inflation, while remaining significant, is likely to fade a little faster than
previously thought. Taking external and domestic influences together, CPI inflation is projected to fall back
slightly more quickly than in February, reaching the target in two years. These projections are conditioned on a
gently rising path for Bank Rate over the next three years.
In the exceptional circumstances presented by Brexit, as specified in its remit, the MPC has been balancing any
significant trade‑off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the
support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. The prospect of excess demand over the forecast

period has reduced the degree to which it is appropriate for the MPC to accommodate an extended period of
inflation above the target. The Committee’s best collective judgement therefore remains that, were the economy
to develop broadly in line with the May Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy
over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a conventional
horizon. As previously, however, that judgement relies on the economic data evolving broadly in line with the
Committee’s projections. For the majority of members, an increase in Bank Rate was not required at this meeting.
All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.
Inflation Report May 2018 Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 1
1 Global economic and financial
market developments
Although momentum in global activity has eased slightly since the start of the year, growth remains
robust. The recovery in global growth since 2016 has meant that spare capacity in advanced
economies has diminished and, in some countries, inflationary pressures have begun to rebuild.
Global financial conditions remain accommodative, despite a rise in short-term interest rates and,
more recently, a fall in equity prices.
Global GDP growth has picked up since 2016. While the pace
of activity weighted by countries’ shares in UK exports slowed
slightly in Q1 (Table 1.A), a good part of that slowing appears
to have reflected temporary factors such as adverse weather
conditions. Geopolitical developments, including the prospect
of trade tariffs, appear to have weighed on risky asset prices.
To the extent that also contributed to the weakening in survey
measures of global output growth since the start of the year,
those indicators may overstate the slowing in growth. Global
GDP growth is projected to pick back up in Q2, and to be
robust over the remainder of 2018 (Section 1.1).
As global growth has strengthened, spare capacity has
diminished and inflationary pressures in some countries have
begun to rebuild (Section 1.2). That has been particularly
apparent in the US, where core inflation and wage growth
have both risen in recent months. Wage growth has also
firmed in the euro area, albeit from subdued rates.
Consistent with these emerging signs of inflationary pressures,
investors now appear to be putting less weight on the
possibility of very low levels of future inflation. Short-term
interest rates in some countries have risen in recent quarters
as expectations of the degree to which central banks will need
to tighten monetary policy in response have increased.
Financial conditions nevertheless remain accommodative
(Section 1.3).
1.1 The momentum in global growth
The strengthening in advanced-economy growth since 2016
has been accompanied by a pickup in investment growth
(Chart 1.1). By adding to the capital stock, that should boost
the supply capacity of those countries and support the outlook
for global activity further ahead. World trade growth has also
strengthened over the past 18 months, having been subdued
in the years following the crisis (Chart 1.2). That pickup has
been broad-based across both advanced and emerging market
economies and has been an important driver of the recent
strength in UK export growth (Section 2).

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 2
The strengthening in global growth over the past two years
has been accompanied by a marked easing in financial
conditions as investor confidence and risk appetite have
increased. International equity prices have risen sharply over
that period (Chart 1.3) and implied equity volatilities,
indicators of investor uncertainty, reached historical lows at
the end of 2017 (Chart 1.4).
Around the time of the February Report, equity prices fell back
somewhat (Chart 1.3) and implied volatility levels rose
(Chart 1.4) as financial market participants appeared to
reassess the outlook for inflationary pressures in the US
(Section 1.2). Although equity prices partially recovered
following that episode, geopolitical developments and
concerns over the outlook for companies’ medium-term
earnings amid the prospect of higher interest rates are
reported to have weighed on these prices in recent weeks.
One important geopolitical development has been the
prospect of a rise in trade protectionism. In March, the
US government announced that it would impose tariffs on
imports of steel and aluminium of 25% and 10% respectively.
Further tariffs have since been proposed by both the US and
China. By raising the cost of imported goods, tariffs tend to
push up prices and reduce demand. The direct impact of the
tariffs announced so far is likely to be very small, since the
goods affected account for only a small share of bilateral trade
between the two countries. But there is a risk that a further
rise in trade protectionism could reduce global activity and
push up inflation in those countries by more.
The euro area
Quarterly euro-area GDP growth slowed to 0.4% in Q1
(Table 1.A), 0.4 percentage points weaker than expected in
February. A good part of that weakness appears to have been
caused by particularly bad weather in some northern European
countries. Business and consumer confidence measures
(Chart 1.5) and the composite PMI indicator of output growth
have fallen since the start of the year, although they remain
above their long-term averages.
Quarterly GDP growth is expected to recover somewhat in Q2
as the weakness caused by adverse weather unwinds. Growth
is projected to be a little above ½% per quarter in the near
term (Table 1.B), supported by above-average consumer and
business confidence as well as accommodative credit
conditions.
The United States
Quarterly US GDP growth was 0.6% in 2018 Q1, weaker than
expected in February. Some of that downside news is likely to
be temporary, reflecting factors such as changes in the timing
of tax refunds. Output surveys, and measures of consumer and
business confidence (Chart 1.5), remain above past averages

and growth is projected to be robust in the near term at close
to ¾% per quarter (Table 1.B).
US GDP growth will be supported by the personal and
corporate tax cuts announced in December 2017, as well as
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which lifted discretionary
spending caps by around US$300 billion over 2018 and 2019.
Together these measures are expected to contribute towards a
rise in the US budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office
projects the deficit to rise from 3.5% of GDP in fiscal year
2017 to 4.6% in 2019.
Emerging market economies
GDP growth in China slowed in Q1 (Table 1.A) but is expected
to pick back up in Q2. Expansionary fiscal policy, robust credit
growth and the strength in global demand growth are
expected to support activity in coming quarters. The outlook
for growth is little changed since February, and the authorities
continue to face challenges in maintaining the pace of GDP
growth while reducing risks to financial stability.
Activity across other emerging market economies (EMEs) was
slightly weaker in 2017 Q4 than expected in February, but
survey indicators continue to point to strong growth in the
near term. Countries with large US dollar-denominated debts
and high external financing requirements are, however,
potentially vulnerable to a sharper-than-expected rise in
US interest rates or a stronger US dollar exchange rate, and
private sector capital flows to EMEs recently turned from a net
inflow to a net outflow. While these developments could
weigh on activity growth, the rises in commodity prices since
mid-2017 (Section 1.2) should support growth for commodity
exporters over the coming quarters.
1.2 Global inflation and monetary policy
expectations
Inflation
Global inflation has been subdued in recent years. Much of
that is likely to have reflected the economic slack that opened
up within countries following the financial crisis. Even as
demand started to recover, that slack meant that inflationary
pressures remained relatively weak.
The strength of global demand has led to much of that slack
being absorbed. In the US, both unemployment and broader
measures of spare capacity, such as underemployment, have
fallen in recent years. And estimates from statistical filters,
which estimate potential supply using past observations of
GDP, inflation and unemployment, suggest that little, if any,
spare capacity remains. As spare capacity has been absorbed,
core inflation and wage growth in the US have picked up
(Table 1.C) and the weight placed by investors on the risk of
very low inflation appears to have fallen (Chart 1.6).

While slack has also diminished in the euro area, statistical
estimates suggest that some spare capacity remains.
Euro-area wage growth picked up slightly in 2017 in response
to the reduction in slack, although core inflation remains
subdued (Table 1.C).
Inflation can also be influenced by global factors through their
impact on export prices.(1) As the proportion of demand
accounted for by imported goods and services has risen
steadily over time, the importance of these global channels for
inflation is likely to have increased.
Highly tradable goods such as commodities exert a particularly
strong influence on inflation rates. Oil and metals prices have
picked up sharply since mid-2017 (Chart 1.7). Consumption of
both oil and metals tends to be closely related to world
activity and part of that rise in prices is likely to have reflected
the strength in global demand, against a backdrop of modest
supply growth. Commodity prices have been volatile in recent
months, predominately reflecting supply factors and
geopolitical developments, including the introduction of
US sanctions on Russia which has led to sharp fluctuations in
the price of aluminium. Overall, rises in the prices of
commodities over the past year are projected to push up
world export price inflation in the near term and by a little
more than in February, although world export price inflation is
projected to slow in subsequent quarters.
Monetary policy expectations
As inflationary pressures in some countries have begun to
emerge, expectations of future official interest rates have
risen.
In the US, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the
target range for the federal funds rate to between 1½% and
1¾% at its March meeting, and left policy unchanged in May
(Chart 1.8). The market-implied path has risen by around
¼ percentage point since the February Report, and suggests a
¾ percentage point rise in the policy rate over the next year.
In addition, as announced in September 2017, the Federal
Reserve’s balance sheet has been shrinking gradually as a
proportion of maturing assets are not replaced. As a result, its
balance sheet had shrunk by around US$100 billion by early
May.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has made no changes to its
policy rates since February, and the market path implies a
gradual rise in policy rates from 2019 onwards (Chart 1.8). As
announced in October, while the ECB is continuing its asset
purchase programme until at least September 2018, it has
(1) There are a number of other global channels that may affect inflation. For example,
the integration of lower-cost producers into the global economy and the increased
importance of global labour pools for domestic supply may have reduced inflation for
advanced economies. For more details, see Carney, M (2017), ‘[De]Globalisation and
inflation’.

reduced the pace of purchases from €60 billion to €30 billion
per month since the beginning of 2018.
At its March meeting, the MPC voted 7–2 to leave Bank Rate
unchanged and unanimously to maintain the stock of
purchased assets (see Box 1). The MPC judged that, given the
prospect of excess demand over the forecast period, an
ongoing tightening of monetary policy would be expected to
be appropriate over the next three years in order to return
inflation sustainably to the 2% target. In the run-up to the
May Report, the market-implied path for Bank Rate reached
1¼% in three years’ time, slightly higher than in the run-up to
the February Report (Chart 1.8). That path continues to imply
that future rises in Bank Rate will be gradual relative to past
tightening cycles (Chart 1.9). The MPC’s May decision is
described in the Monetary Policy Summary and in more detail
in the Minutes of the meeting.
Longer-term interest rates are close to their levels in the
run-up to the February Report in the UK, Germany and France
(Chart 1.10). They have risen slightly in the US, however,
which market contacts report may be partly due to a projected
increase in government bond issuance (Section 1.1) net of
central bank asset purchases. Between late 2013 and 2017,
government bond issuance in major advanced economies
broadly matched purchases of government debt by central
banks. But lower volumes of asset purchases, combined with
projected rises in US government debt issuance, will raise the
stock of government bonds that needs to be held by private
investors. All else equal, that is likely to be pushing up the
required yields on those bonds and hence longer-term interest
rates. Overall, however, longer-term rates remain at
historically low levels, largely reflecting slow-moving
structural factors such as demographics. These factors are
likely to continue to weigh on longer-term rates for some
time.(2)
1.3 Credit conditions facing UK households
and companies
Bank Rate was raised to 0.5% in November and the path of
short-term interest rates has steepened since then. Much of
that rise has been passed through to the borrowing rates
facing households and companies, many of which have risen in
recent months. Most borrowing rates for households remain
lower than in mid-2016, however, as spreads have narrowed.
That narrowing has reflected a rise in global risk appetite and
the stronger outlook for global growth, which reduced the cost
of bank funding relative to policy rates in the UK and many
other countries during 2016–17, as well as strong competition

between lenders in the face of subdued demand for credit in
the UK.
Borrowing costs for households and companies are projected
to rise gradually further in coming years. The market-implied
path for Bank Rate remains upward sloping and bank funding
costs, over and above those market rates, have risen in recent
months, unwinding some of the compression since 2016. This
will feed through gradually to higher retail interest rates.
Nevertheless, credit conditions are likely to remain
accommodative, and this will support the outlook for
consumption and business investment (Section 5).
Bank funding costs and retail deposit rates
As explained in Box 2, an important component of the interest
rates facing households and companies is the cost of bank
funding. During the financial crisis, the spread between
reference rates and bank funding costs rose sharply as
investors demanded higher compensation for the risks
associated with providing funding to banks (Chart 1.11). These
Box 1
Monetary policy since the February Report
In the MPC’s central projection in the February Report, GDP
was expected to grow by around 1¾% per year on average
over the forecast period. While modest by historical standards,
that growth rate was expected to exceed the diminished rate
of supply growth of the economy, which was projected to be
around 1½% per year. As a result, a small margin of excess
demand was projected to emerge by early 2020 and build
thereafter. That would support domestic cost growth,
although CPI inflation was projected to fall back gradually as
the effects of sterling’s past depreciation faded. Conditional on
the path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates
prevailing at the time, inflation remained above the 2% target
in the second and third years of the MPC’s central projection.
At its meeting ending on 21 March 2018, the MPC noted that
recent data releases had been broadly consistent with the view
of the medium-term outlook set out in the February Report.
The prospects for global GDP growth remained strong, and
financial conditions continued to be accommodative, with
little persistent effect from the recent financial market
volatility.
CPI inflation fell from 3.0% in January to 2.7% in February.
Inflation was expected to ease further, although to remain
above the 2% target in the short term. A range of measures of
domestically generated inflation had picked up, although they
generally remained below target-consistent levels. Wage
growth had also increased steadily, as expected. The
unemployment rate had remained low and other indicators
suggested that the margin of spare capacity within the labour
market was limited. Taken together with the increase in
job-to-job flow rates, which could strengthen workers’
bargaining power, this provided increasing confidence that
growth in wages and unit labour costs would pick up to rates
consistent with the inflation target.
As in February, the best collective judgement of the MPC
remained that, given the prospect of excess demand, an
ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast
period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to
its target at a more conventional horizon. All members agreed
that any future increases in Bank Rate were likely to be at a
gradual pace and to a limited extent.
For seven members, however, that did not require an increase
in Bank Rate at this meeting. There had been few surprises
in recent economic data and the February Inflation Report
projections, conditioned on a gently rising path of Bank Rate,
had appeared broadly on track. The May forecast round
would enable the Committee to undertake a fuller assessment
of the underlying momentum in the economy, the degree of
slack remaining and the extent of domestic inflationary
pressures.
Two members favoured a rise in Bank Rate by 25 basis points.
They noted the widespread evidence that slack was largely
used up and that pay growth was picking up, presenting upside
risks to inflation in the medium term. A modest tightening of
monetary policy at this meeting could mitigate the risks from
a more sustained period of above-target inflation that might
ultimately necessitate a more abrupt change in policy.

higher funding spreads meant that the interest rates banks
charged for household borrowing fell by significantly less than
Bank Rate over this period.
In the years following the crisis, funding spreads narrowed as
banks repaired their balance sheets and became more resilient.
Central bank policies also helped to improve conditions over
this period. The Bank’s Funding for Lending Scheme, which
began in 2012, provided funding at rates closer to Bank Rate
and incentivised banks to increase lending.(3) In addition, the
ECB’s longer-term refinancing operations — which provided
finance directly to euro-area banks beginning in late 2011 —
led to an improvement in sentiment in UK bank funding
markets, and some UK banks raised funds directly from these
operations through their foreign subsidiaries.
Since mid-2016, a rise in global risk appetite and the
stronger outlook for activity (Section 1.1) have seen investors
more willing to provide funding for banks, which has helped
drive wholesale unsecured funding spreads narrower still
(Chart 1.11). The Term Funding Scheme, which enabled
banks to draw down funding between August 2016 and
February 2018 at rates close to Bank Rate for a period of
four years, may also have contributed to the narrowing in
funding spreads over this period, although the effect is
estimated to be relatively small.
Spreads on wholesale unsecured funding have widened slightly
since February, although they remain tight (Chart 1.11). That
widening appears to reflect a shift in the balance of supply and
demand for bank debt. Market contacts have cited a number
of drivers of the recent moves in both short and longer-term
funding spreads, including: a rise in US Treasury bill issuance;
higher bank debt issuance in response to regulatory changes;
the prospective end of the ECB’s corporate bond purchase
programme; and recent US corporate tax reform, which has
reduced the demand for bank debt and encouraged greater
share buybacks among US companies. These developments
have been most acute in the US dollar funding market —
where Libor-OIS spreads, in particular, have widened sharply
— but they appear to have affected funding spreads more
broadly as banks compete globally for funding. Wholesale
funding spreads for UK banks are projected to widen slightly
further in coming years.
Banks also fund their lending through deposits. In contrast to
the widening in wholesale funding spreads, spreads on both
time (Chart 1.11) and sight deposits have fallen in recent
months. As discussed in Box 2 of the February Report, sight
deposit rates were some way below Bank Rate prior to the
crisis. Since there are limits to the extent that deposit rates
can be lowered below 0%, deposit rates fell by less than
Bank Rate during the crisis. Since the rise in Bank Rate in

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 8
Box 2
Factors influencing the cost of borrowing for
households and companies
The cost of credit is an important influence on the spending
decisions of households and companies. A key component of
that cost is the ‘credit spread’ — the extent to which the
interest rates facing households and companies exceed their
reference rates, namely Bank Rate or longer-term equivalent
market rates.
This box sets out the factors that can influence the size of the
credit spread and hence the overall cost of borrowing. As
shown in the stylised example in Figure A, these include the
funding spread (the spread between banks’ funding costs and
reference rates), credit risk charges associated with the loan
(which encompass both expected losses and a capital charge),
other costs and a mark-up.
(i) Funding spread. Banks’ funding for the loans they extend
comes from a variety of sources, including wholesale
funding from other lenders and institutional investors, and
customer deposits. Borrowing rates on unsecured
wholesale debt are a useful indicator of the marginal cost
of funding for the banking system as a whole, since this is
a market in which it is possible to raise a large amount of
funding relatively quickly. In addition to other market
influences, the funding spread will reflect the amount of
compensation investors demand for the risk that a bank
might fail. As explained in Section 1.3, that spread has
fallen sharply since the crisis as banks have repaired their
balance sheets and global risk appetite has increased.
(ii) Credit risk charges. These account for the risk that a
borrower may not repay their loan in full, and are formed
of two components: the expected loss associated with the
loan and the capital charge. The expected loss component
is determined by the likelihood that a borrower will
default, together with the loss for the bank should that
default occur. The capital charge component of credit risk
represents the cost of capital funding — which tends to be
more expensive than wholesale debt funding — in order to
absorb losses in the event of a stress scenario. The amount
of capital funding, and hence the cost to the bank of the
capital charge, is affected by national and international
regulation.
(iii) Other costs and mark-up. The remainder of the credit
spread comprises additional factors, including banks’
operating costs, such as staff costs and overheads, and
any mark-up over and above the costs associated with
making a loan. As explained in Section 1.3, strong
competition between lenders means that mark-ups are
likely to have fallen in recent quarters, especially in the
market for mortgage lending.

‘Understanding the price of new lending to households’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin,
2010 Q3. See also Cadamagnani, F, Harimohan, R and Tangri, K (2015), ‘A bank within a bank: how
a commercial bank’s treasury function affects the interest rates set for loans and deposits’,
Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2015 Q2.
November, the corresponding rise in deposit rates has
therefore been somewhat less as the spread between deposit
rates and Bank Rate has begun to return to more normal
levels.
Household borrowing
The compression in bank funding spreads during 2016–17
contributed to a narrowing in spreads on household borrowing
rates (Chart 1.12). A weighted average of spreads on new
household mortgage rates has fallen by a little under
1 percentage point since mid-2016. Spreads on personal loan
rates have also narrowed over that period.
Besides the compression in bank funding spreads, another
factor that may have contributed to the narrowing in spreads
on retail interest rates is the strength in competition between 
Inflation Report May 2018 Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 9
lenders in the face of relatively sluggish demand for credit.
Lenders noted in recent discussions that profit margins for low
loan to value (LTV) products were squeezed, and that
competition has intensified over the past six months in the
market for high LTV mortgages where margins were wider.(4)
That narrowing in credit spreads has meant that many
household borrowing rates remain significantly lower than in
mid-2016, even after rises in short-term interest rates in
recent months have been passed through (Table 1.D). That has
allowed many mortgagors to remortgage to lower interest
rates than they had previously, so effective rates on the
existing stock of household borrowing have fallen since
mid-2016 (Chart 1.13). Rates on personal loans have also
decreased markedly since mid-2016 and have changed little in
recent months, although there is evidence of a tightening in
consumer credit conditions as a whole over the past year
(Section 2).
The upward-sloping market-implied path for short-term
interest rates and recent rises in bank funding spreads are
expected to feed through gradually into a further rise in
household borrowing rates over time. Lending conditions are
nevertheless projected to remain relatively accommodative
and supportive of consumption growth (Section 2).
Corporate financing conditions
Bank lending rates for companies have risen since August 2017
(Table 1.D), mainly reflecting rises in short-term market
interest rates. Since most lending to companies is agreed at a
floating rate, those rises were passed through fairly quickly to
the stock of corporate borrowing.
As well as borrowing from banks, companies can raise finance
by issuing equity. While the FTSE All-Share index has risen in
recent years, much of that has reflected the effect of sterling’s
depreciation on the value of profits earned by UK-listed
companies on their overseas operations. The equity prices
of UK-focused companies have risen by less than the
FTSE All-Share and aggregate US and euro-area indices
(Chart 1.3). Reflecting that, equity risk premia — the
additional return that investors require for holding equities
instead of less risky government debt — are estimated to have
increased for UK-focused companies in recent years.
Larger companies can also raise finance by issuing corporate
bonds. Spreads on sterling corporate bonds have widened a
little in recent months (Chart 1.14), reflecting some of the
same factors that have driven the fall in equity prices and
widening in bank funding spreads. That, combined with
increases in market interest rates, means that corporate bond
yields have risen over the past year, increasing financing costs
for companies.

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 2 Demand and output 10
2 Demand and output
GDP growth dipped in Q1, but much of that decline is likely to be temporary. Over 2017, GDP
growth was modest, but close to the estimated pace of potential supply growth. Sterling’s
depreciation has weighed on real incomes and, in turn, consumption. At the same time, demand
growth has rotated towards net trade and business investment in response to that depreciation and
strong global growth. The rotation in the composition of growth is expected to persist in the near
term as the effects of the depreciation continue to pass through.
Quarterly GDP growth slowed in 2018 Q1 to 0.1%, from 0.4%
in 2017 Q4 (Chart 2.1). That was 0.3 percentage points weaker
than expected at the time of the February Report. As discussed
in Box 3, part of that slowing is likely to have reflected
temporary factors, with the boost from the reopening of the
Forties oil pipeline more than offset by recent disruption from
adverse weather.
Part of the recent weakness is also likely to be revised away
over time, with output growth expected to be revised up to
0.3% in the mature estimate. Preliminary estimates of
quarterly GDP growth are typically revised up, with a greater
upward revision in the first quarter of the year than in other
quarters. In addition, estimates of output growth in quarters
with substantial snowfall have tended to be revised up
significantly. That expected upward revision is also supported
by survey indicators of activity, which overall point to only a
modest slowing in output growth in Q1.
At a sectoral level, a contraction in construction activity
weighed particularly sharply on output growth in Q1
(Chart 2.2). That is consistent with both the role of
weather‑related disruption — the Bank’s Agents report that
construction activity was affected by the snow and by
inclement weather more generally — and the potential for a
substantial upward revision to growth. Early estimates of
construction output have been particularly prone to upward
revisions in recent years. In addition, the purchasing managers’
index for construction suggested that output recovered in
April, probably as the effects of snow abated. Adverse weather
may also account for part of the weakness in consumer
services growth. By contrast, business services activity was
strong and growth in manufacturing output remained positive.
Headline GDP growth is projected to pick back up to 0.4% in
Q2, consistent with survey indicators of growth. There is
considerable uncertainty about momentum in the first half of
the year, however. On the one hand, if adverse weather
accounted for a larger part of the weakness in Q1, then growth

could pick up by more in Q2 (see Box 3). On the other hand, if
more of the weakness reflected underlying growth, then it
could recover by less.
GDP growth is projected to remain around 0.4% over the rest
of the year, as the underlying drivers of growth remain
supportive. Within that, the rotation in demand growth
toward net trade and business investment (Section 2.1), and
away from household spending (Section 2.2), since mid-2016
is projected to persist (Chart 2.3).
2.1 Net trade and business investment
The strength of global growth over the past 18 months,
together with the past depreciation in sterling, appears to have
boosted net trade. That, in turn, should help to support
business investment. Greater external demand for UK goods
and services, combined with a rise in profit margins on those
exports in sterling terms, should encourage exporters and
other firms in the supply chain to expand production and
invest in capacity. In addition, higher import prices will have
encouraged UK households and companies to substitute
towards domestically produced goods and services.
Net trade subtracted 0.4 percentage points from aggregate
demand growth in 2017 Q4. This partly reflected a drop in net
exports of non-monetary gold. But this component is very
volatile and is offset by changes in the contribution to GDP
growth from valuables.(1) The closure of the Forties oil and gas
pipeline in December (see Box 3) also weighed on net trade in
2017 Q4. The resulting fall in domestic production of oil and
gas temporarily reduced fuel exports, and fuel imports
increased to make up the shortfall. That effect should have
unwound in 2018 Q1, as the pipeline was reopened by January,
boosting net trade.
Consistent with the fall in net trade, the nominal trade balance
widened in 2017 Q4. This, however, was more than offset by a
narrowing in the income deficit, reflecting a rise in the net rate
of return on UK foreign direct investment. As a result, the
current account deficit — which reflects the balance of
nominal trade flows and other payments between the
United Kingdom and the rest of the world — narrowed slightly
to 3.6% of GDP.
Over 2017 as a whole, net trade contributed positively to GDP
growth, having subtracted from growth on average over the
past (Chart 2.3). That positive contribution reversed some of
the large fall in 2016 and was greater than expected a year
ago, supported by stronger-than-expected global growth (see
Box 5).
(1) Non-monetary gold is a volatile component of UK trade, reflecting activity in the
London gold bullion market, and has no impact on aggregate demand; movements in
non‑monetary gold are offset by movements in private sector investment in
valuables.

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 2 Demand and output 12
Box 3
The role of temporary factors in recent output
growth
Over the past two quarters, output growth has been affected
by two significant, but temporary, factors. First, the Forties
pipeline, a major oil and gas pipeline in the North Sea, was
closed in December for three weeks, reducing energy
production in 2017 Q4. Second, adverse weather in 2018 Q1
weighed on domestic activity across a number of sectors.
The impact of those temporary factors on GDP growth will
partly depend on the extent to which output is recovered in
subsequent periods. For example, a temporary hit to output in
a given quarter will push quarterly growth below its trend. A
recovery in activity to its previous level will then push growth
above trend in the next quarter before reverting to trend
thereafter, all else equal.
Given those dynamics, estimating the impact of recent
temporary factors is important for assessing the underlying
pace of growth. This box sets out how recent events are
expected to have affected domestic output and the
implications for the path of underlying activity.
The impact of the closure of the Forties pipeline
Over a three week period in December, the Forties pipeline,
which transports around 40% of the UK’s North Sea oil and
gas production, was closed. Comparing the amount of oil and
gas produced that month with usual production levels
suggests that the closure subtracted 0.05 percentage points
from overall output in 2017 Q4, by weighing on output growth
in the mining and quarrying sector, which includes oil and gas
production.
Since the pipeline has reopened, production has returned to its
original level, providing an equivalent boost to growth in Q1.
As discussed in Section 2.2, that closure and subsequent
reopening has also affected the composition of demand,
weighing on net trade in Q4, before boosting it in Q1. The
nature of oil and gas production means none of that lost
output is expected to be made up.
The impact of adverse weather
Snowfall in February and March, and inclement weather in Q1
more generally, is likely to have affected economic activity.
The impact of snow is difficult to estimate, however, and early
estimates of output growth in past quarters with heavy
snowfall have been prone to material upward revisions.
Snow will probably have been a significant driver of reduced
activity in 2018 Q1 in the distribution sector — reflected in the
weakness of retail sales (Section 2.2) — and, in particular, the
construction sector, as transportation was disrupted and
building projects delayed. Output in other consumer services,
such as in food and accommodation services, was also weak in
Q1 and is likely to have been reduced by snow. Offsetting that
to some extent, output in the utilities sector picked up,
probably as cold weather increased energy usage.
Given uncertainty around early estimates, other indicators can
be useful in providing additional evidence on the impact of
snowfall. For example, internet search engine data can provide
a timely indicator of the number of people actually affected by
snow, rather than just the volume of snow overall.(1) Estimates
from the past relationship between Google searches for ‘snow
disruption’ and activity in sectors that tend to be significantly
affected suggests the impact weighed on GDP growth by a
little more than 0.1 percentage points in 2018 Q1. That drag
reflects lower services — particularly the retail and hospitality
sectors — and construction activity, offset somewhat by a
boost to utilities output (Chart A). That is corroborated by
contacts of the Bank’s Agents, who have reported particular
weakness in the construction and consumer services sectors.
Although the negative impact of adverse weather on output
should be temporary, a key question for the near-term outlook
is the extent to which companies catch up any of the output
that they were unable to produce in Q1. Overall, Bank staff
estimate that the amount of output caught up in Q2 is likely
to be negligible. The relationship between internet searches
for snow disruption and activity suggests that such catch-up
has tended to be small over the past. In addition, much of the

indicators’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2011 Q2.

recent snow disruption was in the middle of Q1 which means
that, even if some output is caught up, much of that may have
occurred within the quarter. Nevertheless, it remains difficult
to assess the size of any catch-up effect and the risk remains
that some output is made up, providing a boost to growth in
Q2. That would also have implications for output growth in
Q3 as output growth returns to its underlying trend.
The path of underlying activity
Temporary factors mean that underlying output growth is
expected to have been stronger in both 2017 Q4 and 2018 Q1
than suggested by the headline figures. A substantial share of
the weakness in output in 2018 Q1 in particular is judged to
reflect weather-related disruption that quarter. The recovery
in activity from those effects is projected to boost headline
growth in Q2. However, given the difficulty of estimating the
impact of snow in Q1, there is significant uncertainty around
the underlying path for output.
Continued strong global growth (Section 1) is projected to
support net trade further over 2018 (Table 2.A). The outlook
for net trade will depend, however, on how the supply chains
and capacity of companies, both in the UK and abroad, evolve
in response to Brexit and the associated depreciation in
sterling.
That fall in sterling should incentivise domestic producers of
substitutes for imports to expand production and capacity in
response to higher import prices, if these encourage domestic
companies to source more goods and services from the UK.
Contacts of the Bank’s Agents have reported an increased
incidence of companies switching to domestic suppliers.
Perhaps partly reflecting that, import growth slowed in Q4,
despite the temporary increase in fuel imports that quarter
(Table 2.B). As a result, import penetration — the proportion
of demand satisfied using imported goods and services — has
remained broadly flat.
By boosting exporters’ margins in sterling terms, the fall in
sterling should also support an expansion in export volumes.
Alongside continued robust export growth, sterling export
prices rose by 14% between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q4, and survey
indicators continue to point to strong export growth in coming
quarters (Chart 2.4).
With limited spare capacity for many firms, that expansion in
domestic production, both to support import substitution and
for export, will require investment in additional capacity. The
recovery in business investment has been relatively modest,
however (Table 2.B). As a result, growth in the capital stock
has been particularly weak since the crisis in comparison with
periods following previous recessions (Chart 2.5).
Evidence of increased investment among exporters, in
particular, remains mixed. Although some business survey
indicators suggest that investment intentions among
manufacturers have picked up over the past year, the Bank’s
Agents’ company visit scores suggest that exporters’ and
non-exporters’ investment intentions have been broadly
similar in recent months. And the Bank’s Decision Maker Panel
(DMP) Survey suggests that, despite the rise in their operating 
Inflation Report May 2018 Section 2 Demand and output 14
margins, exporters’ investment spending grew no faster than
that of non-exporters in 2017.
The muted response of business investment is, at least in part,
likely to have reflected the expected impact of Brexit and
associated uncertainty. In the Bank’s DMP Survey, however,
the drag on investment growth from Brexit uncertainty
appeared to diminish in 2017 H2.(2) And respondents to the
2018 Q1 Deloitte CFO Survey no longer viewed the effects of
Brexit as the biggest risk facing their business at the moment.
But the Bank’s Agents reported that that had not yet been
enough to prompt a material change in contacts’ investment
plans and there were few signs that companies were making
up the past weakness in investment, with most survey
indicators of investment intentions little changed (Chart 2.6).
While the recent rise in Bank Rate has raised interest rates on
borrowing for businesses (Section 1), financial conditions
remain accommodative and are likely to have been supporting
investment. Reflecting the factors weighing on investment
growth, however, there are few signs that demand for credit
among businesses has picked up over the past year. Net new
external finance raised by UK corporates has fallen since
mid-2017, driven by lower net equity issuance and
bank lending growth. And respondents to the latest
Credit Conditions Survey suggested demand for credit across
corporates of all sizes was unchanged in 2018 Q1, having fallen
significantly in the second half of 2017.
Overall, business investment is projected to grow at around its
current rate in the near term (Table 2.A). Although global
activity and financial conditions are expected to remain
supportive, investment is likely to remain sensitive to
developments in negotiations around the UK’s future trading
arrangements with the EU.
2.2 Household spending
Consumption
The main driver of consumption growth is real income growth.
Real income has barely risen since 2016 (Chart 2.7), reflecting
subdued nominal wage growth (Section 4) and the reduction
in households’ purchasing power as a result of the fall in
sterling around the EU referendum. In addition, net taxes and
benefits, as well as a fall in dividends receipts, have weighed
on real income growth over that period.(3)
As expected, households have adjusted only gradually to the
slowing in real income growth and the saving ratio has fallen
(Chart 2.8). Consumption growth has averaged 0.3% a
(2) As of April 2018, the survey panel consisted of around 3,700 companies, with around
half responding to the survey each quarter.
(3) As discussed in recent Reports, the fall in dividends receipts and some of the pickup in
tax payments is likely to have reflected changes to the effective rate of tax on
dividends in 2016 that caused many of those payments to be brought forward to the
2015/16 financial year at the expense of payments in future years.

quarter in 2017, compared with 0.6% on average during
2013–16 (Table 2.B).
In recent months, wage growth has started to rise and the
effect of sterling’s depreciation on inflation has diminished
(Section 4). That has eased the squeeze in real income growth,
and should support household spending growth. The extent to
which households continue to spend a greater proportion of
their current income, relative to the recent past, or choose to
rebuild their savings, will depend partly on their confidence
around future incomes and economic prospects. The GfK
measure of consumer confidence has fallen since the start of
2016, and fell slightly further in April, although it remains only
a little below its historical average.
Interest rates and the availability of credit will also affect
households’ spending decisions. Growth in consumer credit
— the type of borrowing most directly associated with
household spending — slowed sharply in March. That may
have been affected by the impact of adverse weather on
consumer spending and, to that extent, should recover in April.
There is also some evidence of a tightening in consumer credit
conditions over the past year, with respondents to the
Credit Conditions Survey, for example, reporting a reduction in
consumer credit availability in 2018 Q1. That said, consumer
credit conditions remain supportive overall, with competition
between lenders reported to be intense.
Interest rates affect consumption via the interest paid and
received on mortgages and deposits, the largest components
of borrowing and saving respectively. As discussed in Section 1,
although mortgage interest rates have risen in response to the
rise in Bank Rate, they remain lower than in mid-2016. Lower
mortgage interest rates over that period have encouraged
households to remortgage (Chart 2.9) to lower their interest
payments, which will have supported consumption growth.
Deposit rates have been broadly stable over that period.
Despite that support from credit conditions, and an easing in
the squeeze on real incomes, consumption is expected to have
grown by only 0.1% in 2018 Q1. As discussed in Box 3, a large
part of that weakness, relative to recent quarters, is likely to
reflect the temporary impact of adverse weather on certain
types of household spending. For example, retail sales — which
account for around one third of household consumption and
will have been affected by snow — fell sharply in Q1. In
addition, there have been more persistent sector-specific
pockets of weakness. Car purchases, for instance, have been
particularly weak over the past year. As explained in Box 4,
however, this has not been matched by more widespread
weakness in durables spending and is likely to mainly reflect
factors specific to the car market.

consumption growth was estimated to have remained around
0.3% and is projected to be stable in coming quarters
(Table 2.B). That path for household spending growth remains
modest by historical standards, consistent with subdued real
income growth.
Housing
Developments in the housing market can provide a signal
about developments in household spending more generally.
That is largely because decisions about whether to buy a house
and whether to spend share common drivers, such as income
expectations and confidence. In addition, house prices can
affect household spending directly. One such channel is by
raising the value of homeowners’ equity, which they can use as
collateral against which to borrow, though this effect is
estimated to be small.
Activity in the housing market has remained broadly stable,
but subdued. Mortgage approvals for house purchase have
been broadly unchanged since 2016 despite support from low
mortgage interest rates (Chart 2.9). Within that, homemover
and buy-to-let activity has fallen somewhat, offset by a pickup
in activity from first-time buyers.
Relatively subdued housing market activity, given the low cost
of credit, is likely to have partly reflected the squeeze in real
incomes over that period and slightly lower confidence in the
general economic situation, with households perhaps choosing
to delay moving as a result. Past regulatory action, such as the
Recommendations by the Financial Policy Committee to
lenders to limit the proportion of new mortgages at loan to
income multiples of 4.5 or above, and around lenders’
affordability tests, are estimated to have had only a small
impact on aggregate mortgage approvals. In coming quarters,
activity in the housing market is likely to pick up modestly as
real income growth recovers somewhat and credit conditions
remain supportive.
National house price inflation slowed to 2.6% in 2018 Q1,
from around 8% in 2016 Q1, according to the average of
lenders’ indices (Chart 2.10). But within that, house price
inflation in London and the South East slowed more sharply,
with prices broadly flat in the four quarters to 2018 Q1.
Although the RICS survey points to an expected pickup in
aggregate house price inflation in the near term, expectations
for house price inflation in those regions remained subdued.
Developments in the housing market will also contribute to
GDP directly through housing investment. Housing investment
growth was relatively robust in 2017, contributing to
above-average growth in overall private sector investment
(Table 2.B). Around four fifths of housing investment consists
of new house building and improvements to existing buildings.
The pickup in housing starts in 2016 (Chart 2.11) pushed up
housing investment substantially over 2017. However, housing

Box 4
Implications of recent developments in the
car market for consumer spending
Having been broadly stable during 2014–16, new car purchases
fell sharply in 2017 (Chart A). Slow real income growth is
likely to have been one factor weighing on car purchases but,
as this box explains, factors specific to the car market are also
likely to have been a significant driver of that weakness.
Consistent with that, spending on other types of durables has
remained relatively resilient. As cars only account for around
5% of consumer spending, the implications of the weakness in
car spending for the broader outlook is therefore likely to be
limited.
Some of the recent volatility in the car market is likely to have
reflected tax changes. Rises in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) for
new cars, based on CO2 emissions, came into effect on
1 April 2017. That is likely to have led to some purchases being
brought forward ahead of that date, supporting registrations in
2017 Q1 and contributing to the subsequent fall. Additional
rises in VED on new diesel vehicles from 1 April 2018 may have
had a similar effect in 2018 Q1, although the disruption from
adverse weather has probably offset some of that effect.
Registrations rose in February, fell in March and then rose
again in April. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents also report
that uncertainty around the future tax treatment of
higher‑emission vehicles may have weighed on spending in
2017.
Developments in the way cars are financed may also have
affected sales. In recent years, structural changes in new car
finance have made it easier to replace existing cars with new
ones, which will have driven some of the pickup in new
registrations over that period.(1) That structural shift appears
to have come to an end, with 90% of new cars now purchased
with some form of car finance. As such it is unlikely to support
growth in car purchases to the same degree going forward.
The effect of that maturing of the car finance market on
demand has been compounded by a pickup in car retail prices
since mid-2016 (Chart B). Car retailers had held prices broadly
flat during 2015–16 H1, squeezing their margins, with contacts
of the Bank’s Agents reporting that retailers were trying to
boost demand in the UK, amid relatively weak demand in the
rest of Europe. Since mid-2016, however, prices have risen, in
part as relatively strong demand through 2016 provided car
dealers with scope to rebuild their margins, but also as the
impact of sterling’s depreciation during 2016 was passed on to
consumers.
Overall, new car purchases are expected to remain around
their current level as the factors dragging on spending persist.
This, however, is not expected to be indicative of prospects for
broader consumption growth, which is expected to remain
around 0.3%, abstracting from recent snow-related disruption
(Section 2.2).

investment growth is likely to be weaker in 2018 (Table 2.A).
New housing starts were broadly flat during 2017 and are
expected to have slowed in 2018 Q1 as snow and other
weather-related disruption hampered construction activity.
Reflecting that, a timelier measure of private housing starts
from the NHBC — which accounts for around 80% of new
builds and feeds into official data — fell substantially in Q1. In
addition, growth in services associated with property
transactions, which account for the remaining one fifth of
housing investment activity, is likely to remain relatively
subdued, consistent with the modest projected pickup in
housing market activity.
2.3 Government
The MPC’s projections are conditioned on the Government’s
tax and spending plans detailed in the March 2018 Spring
Statement. In line with the commitment to move to a single
fiscal event per year, there were no substantive new tax or
spending measures announced, relative to the November 2017
Budget. Under those plans, the fiscal consolidation continues,
with public sector net borrowing projected to fall to 1.3% of
nominal GDP by 2020/21.

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 3 Supply and the labour market 19
3 Supply and the labour market
Labour demand growth remains robust and a very limited degree of slack is left in the economy.
Productivity growth is projected to rise from its recent weak pace, but to remain well below
pre-crisis rates. As a result, the pace at which output can grow without generating inflationary
pressures is likely to be modest.
The outlook for GDP depends on the evolution of demand
(Section 2) and potential supply growth. Supply, in turn,
depends on the supply of labour and how productively that
labour can be employed. The MPC conducted its annual
reassessment of supply-side conditions ahead of the
February Report. This section considers the latest data in
the context of that assessment.
The balance between demand and supply — that is, the degree
of slack or excess demand in both the labour market and the
wider economy — is an important determinant of wage
growth and broader inflationary pressures. During the financial
crisis, output fell, unemployment rose substantially and a
significant degree of slack opened up (Chart 3.1). In the years
following the crisis, demand could therefore grow more
quickly than supply as spare capacity was absorbed. The
unemployment rate, for example, fell from 8.5% in 2011 to
4.2% in the three months to February 2018. Although output
growth was weaker than expected in Q1, that is likely in large
part to have reflected temporary disruption due to adverse
weather (Section 2), which is unlikely to have had any
significant effect on spare capacity. Overall, a very limited
degree of slack is judged likely to remain (Section 3.1).
Productivity growth has been persistently weak since the crisis
(Section 3.2). Overall potential supply growth is therefore
judged to have been lower than in the past, despite a boost
from greater labour supply (Chart 3.1). Part of that boost
reflected relatively strong population growth. Population
growth has slowed and is projected to remain lower than in
recent years. While potential productivity growth is projected
to rise slightly, the speed limit of the economy is expected to
remain modest relative to pre-crisis norms (Section 5).
3.1 Labour market developments and slack
As slack has been absorbed, growth in total hours worked has
slowed. But its precise path has been affected by volatility in
participation and average hours worked (Chart 3.2). Both fell
sharply during 2017 H2 and, while the drop in participation has
unwound, average hours worked remain lower than a year ago.

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 3 Supply and the labour market 20
Looking through recent volatility, employment has grown
faster than expected at the time of the February 2017 Report,
even as output has grown broadly in line with expectations
(see Box 5). Indicators of employment intentions have been
stable, with most at levels above past averages. And the
number of vacancies relative to the size of the labour force has
continued to rise (Table 3.A).
That stronger-than-expected employment growth has been
partly reflected in a larger-than-expected fall in the
unemployment rate over the past year. Wage growth was
nevertheless weaker than expected over that period and,
partly as a result, the MPC revised down its estimate of the
equilibrium unemployment rate to 4¼% in February. There
are a number of factors that may have reduced the equilibrium
rate in recent years. Those include rises in the average age and
educational attainment of the workforce, which have tended
to be associated with lower unemployment rates. Increased
flexibility within the labour market is also likely to have
reduced flows from employment to unemployment and hence
the equilibrium rate of unemployment.(1)
The unemployment rate is projected to fall further to 4.1% in
2018 Q2 (Chart 3.3), a little below the February projection
and its assumed equilibrium level. That is consistent with
other signs that the labour market is tight. Along with the rise
in vacancies, survey indicators suggest that recruitment
difficulties are somewhat elevated (Table 3.A). And, having
fallen during the crisis, job-to-job flows have gradually
returned to pre-crisis rates (Section 4).
The MPC also continues to judge that there is no material
spare capacity among those not actively looking for a job. The
‘marginal attachment’ ratio — the proportion of the
population who report that they would like a job but are not
currently seeking one — has fallen sharply in recent years
(Chart 3.4). That suggests little scope for the participation
rate to rise and it is projected to be broadly flat, reflecting two
offsetting factors. The rising average age of the population is
likely to weigh on aggregate labour force participation because
the participation rate of older people tends to be lower. But
participation rates among older people have increased steadily
in recent years and this trend is expected to continue.
There are some signs of underemployment, and therefore
scope for a cyclical boost to output through increases in
average hours worked. Average hours worked in 2017 Q4 were
below the hours that households said they would like to work,
although by much less than a few years ago. The proportion of
those working part-time who would prefer a full-time job is
also still some way above its pre-crisis level, despite falling as
the proportion of workers in full-time jobs has increased
(Chart 3.5). But any scope for average hours to rise as that

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 3 Supply and the labour market 21
spare capacity is absorbed is expected to be broadly offset by
a structural downward trend in average hours worked. That
trend is partly due to an ageing workforce, as older workers
typically want to work fewer hours.(2)
With little slack in the labour market, growth in the size of the
workforce will come mainly from population growth. The
MPC’s forecasts assume that the population evolves in line
with the ONS’s latest principal population projection,
published in October 2017. Under that projection, population
growth remains slower than in recent years, reducing the
contribution from annual population growth to labour supply
by 0.2 percentage points to 0.5%.
A key influence on population growth is net migration to the
UK. Net migration rose slightly to 244,000 in the year to
2017 Q3, bringing it back in line with the ONS’s projection
(Chart 3.6). The level remains around 90,000 below net
migration in the year to 2016 Q2, however. Within that,
net migration from non-EU countries has risen a little, but
EU net migration — which tends to be disproportionately for
work-related reasons — has fallen.
The ONS projects net migration to fall somewhat further in
coming years (Chart 3.6), reducing population growth slightly.
That path is uncertain, however, and there is a risk that net
migration could fall more sharply. The extent to which it does
will depend on a number of factors including the UK’s relative
economic performance. Bank staff analysis suggests that the
subdued outlook for UK GDP per capita, combined with
stronger growth prospects in other countries (Section 1),
would, on its own, reduce net migration by a little more than
implied by the ONS projection over the next three years.(3)
3.2 Productivity
The sharp fall in hours worked during 2017 H2 provided a
temporary boost to hourly productivity growth over that
period (Chart 3.7). Average hours worked can be volatile from
one quarter to another, however. Abstracting from that,
growth in output per worker — which tends to be more stable
— has continued to be weak, and is expected to have been
0.5% in the year to 2018 Q1. On both measures, productivity
growth remains some way short of its pre-crisis average.
A standard growth-accounting framework suggests that
around half of the weakness in productivity growth since 2010
has been associated with slow growth in the amount of capital
per worker — the resources and equipment available to
produce output. In turn, that reflects subdued business
investment over much of that period (Section 2). Given this,

a recovery in productivity growth is in part likely to be reliant
on a pickup in business investment growth.
The remainder of the weakness in productivity growth is
accounted for by weak growth in the efficiency with which
labour and capital are put to use, known as total factor
productivity. The shortfall appears to have been focused
within a few sectors, including financial and insurance services
and manufacturing.(4) That might suggest sector-specific
factors have been important, for example the role of higher
financial sector leverage prior to the crisis and the
deleveraging since then. Equally, broader trends may have
disproportionately affected some sectors. For example, growth
in world trade tends to be associated with productivity gains
through greater economies of scale and increased
competition, and so productivity within the manufacturing
sector — which tends to be highly integrated within global
supply chains — is likely to have been affected by the
weakness in trade growth following the crisis.
As well as these pre-existing trends, the outlook for
productivity growth is likely to be affected by changes in
trading arrangements as a result of Brexit.(5) The anticipation
of, and uncertainty around, those arrangements has been
weighing on business investment (Section 2), and
consequently growth in the capital stock.
Overall, the MPC judges that growth in output per worker
is likely to pick up slightly in coming quarters, in part
reflecting the past pickup in business investment (Section 2).
Four-quarter growth in hourly productivity is expected to be
volatile during 2018, however, as the boost from the past fall
in hours worked unwinds and the recent weather-related
disruption distorts headline GDP growth to some extent
(see Box 3). More generally, potential productivity growth is
expected to remain subdued relative to pre-crisis norms, as
the effect of Brexit and other factors weighing on it since the
crisis persist (Section 5).

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 4 Costs and prices 23
4 Costs and prices
CPI inflation has fallen by more than had been expected in the February Report, to 2.5% in March
from 3.0% in December. The impact of sterling’s depreciation appears to have diminished slightly
more quickly than expected and inflation is projected to fall further towards the 2% target as it
continues to diminish. By contrast, domestic cost pressures appear to be rebuilding, supported by
rising wage growth.
4.1 Consumer price developments and the
near-term outlook
CPI inflation fell to 2.5% in March from 3.0% in
December 2017 (Chart 4.1). Although still above the MPC’s
2.0% target, that was 0.4 percentage points lower than
projected in the February Report. Around 0.1 percentage points
of that downside news reflected the effect of the annual
update of the CPI component weights by the ONS. The
majority of the news, however, reflected the impact of both
domestic and external pressures, with lower‑than-expected
contributions from a range of components within both
services and goods.
Goods price inflation, which tends to be relatively
import‑intensive, slowed by more than expected in 2018 Q1
(Chart 4.2). That suggests that the effect of the pass-through
of higher import prices following sterling’s depreciation to CPI
inflation has diminished by slightly more than expected,
having probably peaked in 2017 Q4. The contribution of that
pass-through has accounted almost entirely for the period of
above-target inflation since 2016 and is expected to diminish
further during the rest of the year (Section 4.2).
Despite the fall in the contribution from import prices,
CPI inflation is likely to rise slightly in coming months due to
changes in taxation and utility bills. First, the ‘Soft Drinks
Industry Levy’, a tax on companies producing soft drinks with
high levels of sugar, is expected to push up inflation by around
0.1 percentage points from April before dropping out of the
12-month comparison a year later. Second, rises in household
energy tariffs were announced by some utility companies in
April. Those rises are a little larger and sooner than expected in
the February Report (Section 4.2).
The path for inflation further ahead will depend on the balance
between the diminishing contribution from higher import
prices and rising domestic inflationary pressures. Import price
growth has continued to slow and the MPC now judges that

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 4 Costs and prices 24
import prices will push up inflation by somewhat less in
coming years than it previously judged (Section 4.2). Domestic
inflationary pressures, which had been subdued, are showing
signs of picking up and are expected to firm further
(Section 4.3). In particular, regular pay growth has continued
to rise and is expected to support unit labour cost growth,
given subdued productivity growth (Section 3). Inflation
expectations, which can influence wage and price‑setting, have
been broadly stable and remain consistent with inflation
returning to the target in the medium term (Section 4.4).
4.2 External cost pressures
Energy prices
Energy prices affect CPI inflation directly through their impact
on petrol prices and domestic gas and electricity bills. Coupled
with this, there are indirect effects, for example on production
and transport costs, which affect companies’ costs. The
combined weight of those direct and indirect effects is
estimated to make up around 9% of the CPI basket.
Changes in oil prices tend to be passed on to retail fuel prices,
and therefore CPI inflation, relatively quickly. The spot price
of oil has risen further since February (Section 1) and that will
put some slight upward pressure on petrol prices over the next
few months. The oil futures curve — on which the MPC’s
forecasts are conditioned — remains downward sloping,
however (Chart 4.3). As such, the contribution from fuel
prices to inflation is expected to fall to below average from
December 2018.
There was a temporary rise in the spot price of gas in March
(Chart 4.3) due to high demand during the period of unusually
cold weather (see Box 3). Domestic energy companies tend to
agree the purchase of future gas supplies well in advance and
so the futures curve, which rose by less, matters more for the
price of energy for households.
In April, three large utility companies announced a rise in their
prices, which may in part reflect higher wholesale prices from
mid-2017 being passed on with a lag. Other providers are
expected to announce similar price rises and, as those are
implemented in the coming months, the total effect is
expected to add around 0.1 percentage points to CPI inflation
over the next year, relative to the February Report.
Household utility bills are also likely to be affected by
upcoming regulatory changes to caps on standard variable
tariff (SVT) accounts. In April, Ofgem increased the existing
cap on SVTs for prepayment customers and the Government
has proposed a cap on SVT accounts not already capped,
expected to be implemented at the end of 2018.
SVTs are the only tariffs captured in the CPI basket, so only
changes in those tariffs will be directly reflected in CPI

inflation. But, depending on how utility companies react to
those changes, there may be effects on other tariffs which
could affect energy costs for households and companies. For
example, utility companies could seek to maintain their overall
margins by increasing the prices of fixed-rate tariffs.
Pass-through of the depreciation of sterling to
non-energy consumer prices
Episodes of large exchange rate changes tend to result in
sustained movements in inflation away from the 2.0% target.
The current overshoot of inflation almost entirely reflects the
pass-through of the boost to import prices from the
depreciation of sterling which, although volatile since the
February Report, remains around 15% below its peak in late
2015 (Chart 4.4).
As set out in previous Reports, Bank staff have estimated that,
on average over the past, 60% of changes in the sterling value
of non-energy foreign export prices are subsequently reflected
in UK import prices, with most of that first-stage pass-through
taking around a year. Between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q4,
non‑energy import prices rose by around 10%. That is around
half of the rise in foreign export prices in sterling terms
(Chart 4.5) and so less than had been expected.
Import price growth slowed in the latest data (Chart 4.5) and
a recent survey on corporate pricing by the Bank’s Agents has
suggested a further easing in import price inflation over 2018.
As a result, the MPC now judges that import prices will rise by
55% of the rise in sterling foreign export prices since 2015 Q4,
somewhat less than projected in February (Section 5).
The rise in import prices so far appears to have been passed
on to consumer prices broadly as expected. Bank staff have
estimated that for any rise in import prices, the CPI tends to
rise by around 30% of that. That pass-through is gradual, with
the peak impact on inflation coming after a year and inflation
continuing to be pushed up for a further three years after that.
In the November 2016 Report, the MPC judged that, due to
the nature of the depreciation since 2015 Q4, the speed of
pass-through from import prices to consumer prices was likely
to be faster than on average in the past.
The effect of the rise in import prices on CPI inflation can be
seen most clearly in more import-intensive components
(Chart 4.6). Inflation in those components has slowed in
recent months and by more than was expected in February
(Section 4.1). That brought the estimated degree of
pass‑through from the rise in import prices seen so far broadly
into line with the MPC’s judgement in November 2016, having
been slightly above it at the time of the February Report. The
effect of import prices on inflation is expected to diminish
further over the next couple of years and somewhat more
quickly than projected in February, reflecting the lower
projected path for import price inflation (Section 5).

4.3 Domestic cost pressures
Domestically generated inflation
Inflation depends both on external cost pressures and on
domestically generated inflation (DGI), which will be
influenced by the degree of spare capacity in the economy.
While DGI is not directly observable, there are a number of
indicators that are closely linked to that concept, the majority
of which rose in the latest data (Chart 4.7). As set out in
previous Reports, some of those measures can be affected by
changes in sterling’s exchange rate. While that had been
pushing up some measures, the effect is likely to have
diminished in recent quarters.
Given the expected slowing in world export price inflation and
the diminishing pass-through from the depreciation of sterling,
most indicators of domestic inflation will need to rise further
to be consistent with CPI inflation at the MPC’s 2% target.
With very little slack judged to remain (Section 3), domestic
inflationary pressures are projected to continue to build to
more normal levels over the next year (Section 5).
Wage growth and unit labour costs
The cost of labour, and in particular wages, is the largest
domestic cost facing most companies and so is a
significant indicator of domestic inflationary pressures. The
impact of labour costs on companies’ production costs will
depend on unit labour cost (ULC) growth — how fast labour
costs are rising relative to productivity. Wage growth has
been weaker than expected in recent years, but that has
partly been driven by weaker-than-expected productivity
growth (Section 3). As such, ULC growth has been
less subdued (Chart 4.8) and closer to expectations.
Greater‑than‑expected slack in the labour market,
however, appears to have weighed on both wage and ULC
growth. As a result, the MPC revised down its estimate of the
equilibrium unemployment rate. More recently, as slack has
been absorbed the drag on wage growth is easing.
During the financial crisis, unemployment rose sharply,
job-to-job flows and resignations fell (Chart 4.9), and
on‑the‑job searches rose. These trends were consistent with a
fall in the demand for labour and employees becoming less
confident about their job prospects. A greater weight on job
security during that period is probably one factor that
dampened wage expectations and employee bargaining
power. Despite that, wage growth did not fall by as much as
productivity growth, so ULC growth was less subdued
(Chart 4.8) and companies’ margins were squeezed. One
possible explanation is that employers tend to avoid cutting
pay where possible, preferring to freeze pay even if
productivity and revenues are falling. Reflecting that, the share
of workers receiving 0% pay rises rose sharply during the crisis
(Chart 4.10).

In more recent years, unemployment has fallen back
significantly and churn in the labour market has recovered,
with the proportion of people moving from one job to another
now around its pre-crisis rate (Chart 4.9). That suggests some
recovery in confidence among employees in their labour
market prospects. As a result, businesses have needed to raise
wages for new recruits in order to attract staff. The REC
survey, for example, suggests that pay growth has risen for
new joiners in recent years (Table 4.A), and the Bank’s Agents
have reported a greater willingness among companies to
increase pay growth for new recruits and key staff. In contrast,
as set out in the February Report, data from the Annual Survey
of Hours and Earnings suggested that pay growth for those
staying in their jobs remained subdued in the year to
April 2017.
There are now signs that regular pay growth is starting to rise
more broadly as the labour market tightens further. Annual
regular pay growth rose to 2.8% in the three months to
February and is projected to remain around 2¾% over the rest
of the year, broadly as projected in February (Table 4.B).
Although there was downside news in the contribution from
bonuses, and hence total pay growth, bonuses tend to be
volatile. As such, total pay growth is expected to rise a little
further during 2018.
In addition to wage growth, ULC growth will also depend on
growth in non-wage labour costs. Further increases in
minimum contributions for auto-enrolled pensions are
projected to push up non-wage labour costs in 2018 Q2 and
2019 Q2 but, as these rises affect only a subset of employees,
the impact on aggregate ULC growth is expected to be
modest.
Weaker-than-expected growth in output per head in 2017
Q4 meant that ULC growth rose by more than expected in
February, consistent with some strengthening in domestic
cost pressures over the past few months. And ULC growth is
expected to firm over 2018 as pay growth continues to
outstrip productivity growth (Section 5).
4.4 Inflation expectations
Inflation expectations can influence domestic inflation
through wage and price-setting behaviour. For example, if
companies and households become less confident that
inflation will return to the MPC’s 2% target, that may lead to
changes in wage and price-setting that make inflation persist
above the target for longer. The MPC monitors a range of
indicators derived from financial market prices and surveys of
households and companies to assess whether inflation
expectations remain consistent with the target.

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 5 Prospects for inflation 29
5 Prospects for inflation
Inflation has fallen by more than expected since the start of the year, reaching 2.5% in March. It
seems likely that pass-through of sterling’s depreciation to import prices is somewhat smaller than
previously expected. GDP growth was weaker than expected in Q1, in part due to a temporary drag
from adverse weather. The MPC continues to judge, however, that a very limited degree of slack
remains in the economy. As in February, based on a conditioning path for Bank Rate that embodies
three 25 basis point rises over the next three years, a small margin of excess demand is likely to
emerge by early 2020, raising domestic inflationary pressures such that inflation settles at the
2% inflation target.
GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in Q1, according to the
preliminary estimate, from 0.4% in Q4 and below the
projection three months ago. That partly reflected the
temporary disruptive impact of adverse weather across the
country (see Box 3). As in the February Report, the MPC
continues to judge that very little spare capacity remains in
the economy. Growth is likely to be revised up a little over
time (Section 2) and to the extent that weakness in activity
reflected disruptive weather, it is unlikely to have had any
significant effect on the degree of spare capacity. Moreover,
the labour market has remained robust, with unemployment
falling further in the three months to February. In Q2, as the
drag from weather effects unwinds, growth is expected to
bounce back to 0.4%, broadly consistent with the latest
survey indicators, although there will be considerable
uncertainty about underlying momentum in the first half of
the year until more data become available.
Growth also dipped in the euro area, United States and China
at the start of the year. This appears to reflect erratic factors,
including weather. Overall momentum in the global economy
is still judged to be robust.
UK CPI inflation has fallen back more rapidly than expected
three months ago. It now seems likely that pass-through of
the past depreciation of sterling to import prices is somewhat
smaller than previously thought. Regular pay growth has
picked up, broadly as expected three months ago, and there
are continuing signs that domestic inflationary pressures are
building gradually.
Financial conditions are similar to those underlying the
February Report. The MPC’s projections are conditioned on a
path for Bank Rate that reaches 1.2% by early 2021 
Inflation Report May 2018 Section 5 Prospects for inflation 30
(Table 5.A).(1) In the 15 working days to 2 May, the sterling ERI
was 1% higher than in the run-up to the February Report, but
it remains 15% below its late-2015 peak. As in previous
Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on the average
of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdom’s
eventual trading relationship with the European Union. They
also assume that households and companies base their
decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to those
new trading arrangements. Since the February Report, a draft
Withdrawal Agreement between the UK Government and the
European Union, including an implementation period ending
on 31 December 2020, has been published. This pushes back
the date at which the UK would move to new trading
arrangements.
The assumptions underlying the MPC’s May projections
and the medium-term outlook for growth and inflation,
summarised in Table 5.B, are broadly similar to the projections
set out in the February Report. Following a period of weakness
at the start of this year, GDP is then projected to grow at
around 1¾% a year (Chart 5.1). That modest growth is
supported by robust global growth (Key Judgement 1), as the
euro-area recovery continues and US growth picks up further.
Robust world activity continues to support UK exports, with
the past depreciation of the sterling exchange rate also
providing a continued boost to net trade, which contributes
positively to growth over the next three years
(Key Judgement 2). That in turn supports UK business
investment, helping to offset the drag from uncertainty
around the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements.
Household spending growth remains subdued over the
forecast period, in line with the muted recovery in real income
growth.
Although demand growth is projected to be modest by
historical standards, it is faster than supply growth, which is
restrained by continued weakness in productivity growth
(Key Judgement 3). With very little slack at the start of the
forecast period, the economy moves into excess demand by
early 2020 and domestic inflationary pressures build further
(Key Judgement 4). Inflation falls more rapidly than in
February (Chart 5.3), reflecting a smaller assumed boost
from the past depreciation of sterling, and settles at the
2% target by mid-2020 (Chart 5.2).
At its meeting ending on 9 May 2018, the MPC voted to
maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%, to maintain the stock of sterling
(1) Unless otherwise stated, the projections shown in this section are conditioned on:
Bank Rate following a path implied by market yields; the stock of purchased gilts
remaining at £435 billion and the stock of purchased corporate bonds remaining at
£10 billion throughout the forecast period and the Term Funding Scheme (TFS), all
three of which are financed by the issuance of central bank reserves; the
Recommendations of the Financial Policy Committee and the current regulatory plans
of the Prudential Regulation Authority; the Government’s tax and spending plans as
set out in the Spring Statement 2018; commodity prices following market paths; and
the sterling exchange rate remaining broadly flat. For more details see the ‘Data from
the May 2018 Inflation Report’ section at www.bankofengland.co.uk/inflationreport/2018/may-2018.

Chart 5.1 GDP projection based on market interest rate

The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth. It has been conditioned
on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b). To the left of the vertical dashed line, the distribution
reflects uncertainty around revisions to the data over the past. To aid comparability with the official
data, it does not include the backcast for expected revisions, which is available at Data from the
May 2018 Inflation Report. To the right of the vertical line, the distribution reflects uncertainty over
the evolution of GDP growth in the future. If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to
prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of
GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan chart
is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on
30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie
somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions
GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this
has been depicted by the light grey background. See the box on page 39 of the November 2007
Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion
and to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at
£435 billion. The factors behind that decision are set out in the
Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and in
more detail in the Minutes of the meeting.(2) The remainder of
this section sets out the MPC’s projections, and the risks
around them, in more detail.
5.1 The MPC’S key judgements and risks
Key Judgement 1: global growth remains robust
Global growth has strengthened over the past two years, with
many countries growing at above-trend rates. That has
contributed to a rise in commodity prices, with dollar oil prices
up a further 6% since February. It has also reduced spare
capacity in many countries, which is projected to support
global inflation over the forecast period.
In the euro area, where the recovery has been particularly
marked, growth dipped to 0.4% in Q1 in contrast to the pickup
suggested by surveys at the start of the year. Some of that
news may well reflect a drag from weather effects that will
probably unwind in Q2. Although surveys have also softened a
little, they remain consistent with quarterly growth a little
over ½%, above its estimated potential rate. Growth is
projected to remain around that rate in the second half of the
year. It slows towards potential thereafter as the support to
growth from accommodative monetary policy and the past
improvement in confidence and credit conditions wanes.
Indicators of domestic inflationary pressures have remained
subdued in the euro area, consistent with a degree of slack
remaining in the economy. Inflation is projected to rise to
around 1¾% over the forecast period, as that slack is
absorbed.

Chart 5.2 CPI inflation projection based on market interest rate
expectations, other policy measures as announced
Charts 5.2 and 5.3 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future. They have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b). If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail
on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan charts are constructed so that outturns of inflation
are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on
the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background. See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002
Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

Chart 5.3 CPI inflation projection in February based on market
interest rate expectations, other policy measures as announced
Inflation Report May 2018 Section 5 Prospects for inflation 32
The US has been growing at above-trend rates since 2016 and
core inflation has picked up more recently. Growth is
projected to fall back more slowly over the forecast period
than had been assumed three months ago (Table 5.C) as a
consequence of additional support from fiscal policy measures
signed into law in February. With the economy already
operating close to, if not a little above, full capacity, inflation
is projected to be above 2% from around the middle of this
year.
GDP growth in China slowed in Q1 but is expected to pick up
in Q2. Expansionary fiscal policy, robust credit growth and the
strength in global demand growth, is expected to support
activity in coming quarters. In other emerging economies,
commodity producers are benefiting from higher prices for
their exports. Emerging economies, particularly those with
large US dollar-denominated debts and high external
financing requirements, remain vulnerable, however, to a
sharper-than-expected rise in US interest rates or a stronger
US dollar exchange rate.
Taking advanced and emerging economies together, based on
PPP weights, global growth is projected to be 4% in 2018
before slowing to 3½% (Table 5.C). Weighted by UK export
shares, growth is around 3%, slowing in the second half of the
forecast period as slack is absorbed. The projection is broadly
similar to that of three months ago (Chart 5.4) but the slight
softening in momentum, which was widespread across regions,
means the risks around it are now judged to be balanced
rather than weighted to the upside. There is still a risk of a
larger upswing in productivity growth than projected, which
would allow economies to grow more quickly before upside
risks to inflation emerge. On the downside, trade tensions
have increased (Section 1). While the tariffs announced
by the United States and China to date are likely to have
limited effects on activity and inflation, there is a risk of
escalation.
Key Judgement 2: investment and net trade support
UK demand, while consumption growth remains subdued
While the world economy has strengthened, UK growth has
slowed to modest rates. On the expenditure side, UK growth
has rotated towards net trade and business investment and
away from consumption (Section 2). That pattern continues
over the forecast period as households continue to face weak
growth in real incomes.
Net trade contributed positively to growth in 2017 and is
projected to continue to do so throughout the forecast period.
That in part reflects the support to UK exports from strong
overseas demand. Net trade has also been supported by the
lower sterling exchange rate, which boosts exports and
discourages imports. For some time, both exports and imports
have been projected to grow relatively weakly as companies
here and abroad begin to adjust trading relationships in light

of the United Kingdom’s vote to withdraw from the
European Union. As set out in Box 5, gross trade flows have
been stronger than projected over the past year, suggesting
that little adjustment has happened so far. Moreover, the draft
transition agreement to preserve UK access to the single
market until end-2020 suggests that most of the adjustment
still to come is likely to happen beyond the three-year forecast
horizon. Gross trade flows are therefore projected to grow a
little faster over coming years than previously assumed
(Table 5.D), but these changes have no implications for net
trade or, therefore, aggregate demand.
Business investment has been supported by external demand,
limited spare capacity, the relatively high rate of return on
capital and the low cost of finance, even as the rise in
Bank Rate in November has fed through to borrowing costs
(Section 1). Its pace of growth has, however, been more
modest than would be expected at this stage of the economic
cycle and relative to investment growth in other countries,
probably a result of the anticipation of and uncertainty over
Brexit, as suggested by a range of survey evidence and
contacts of the Bank’s Agents. Overall, business investment
is projected to grow a little faster than current rates
(Table 5.D), as global growth and capacity pressures
encourage spending, and the drag on growth from
uncertainty wanes.
Consumption growth has slowed to subdued rates.
Households have faced a period of falling real income as the
lower sterling exchange rate fed through to higher prices
(Key Judgement 4). Aggregate household real incomes are no
longer falling, but real income growth is still subdued and rises
only a little over the forecast period. Spending has not slowed
as much as total post-tax income, and the saving ratio has
fallen to a relatively low level (Section 2).
There have been signs of weakness in consumer spending in
Q1 including in data on retail sales and consumer credit
(Section 2). In the central projection, that weakness is largely
assumed to reflect erratic factors, including the impact of
adverse weather, that unwind in the second quarter. Annual
consumption growth recovers gradually to reach 1¼% by
2019, broadly in line with income (Table 5.D). That is well
below its historical average rate of around 3%. The saving
ratio is projected to remain around its current rate. There
is greater-than-usual uncertainty about the near-term
momentum in consumer spending and the extent to which
households adjust their spending and saving to the past fall
in their real incomes.
Weak real income growth has probably also weighed on the
housing market. House price inflation has slowed and activity
remains subdued (Table 5.E). That is despite average mortgage
interest rates falling over recent years as credit spreads have
narrowed (Section 1). Over the forecast period, a gradual

widening in credit spreads, albeit a slightly smaller one than
assumed three months ago, alongside the gently upward
sloping yield curve, raises mortgage rates, but the recovery in
income growth supports the housing market. House price
inflation is projected to pick up a little and approvals to rise
(Table 5.E), though they remain significantly below levels seen
prior to the crisis.
Key Judgement 3: very little slack remains and the pace of
potential supply growth is modest
There is a limit to how rapidly the economy can grow without
putting upward pressure on inflation. In the aftermath of the
financial crisis, the UK economy had scope to grow above its
potential rate as spare capacity was used up. Now, with
unemployment around its equilibrium rate and few signs of
slack elsewhere, the speed at which demand can grow
sustainably depends on how fast supply capacity is expanding.
As set out in the MPC’s February reassessment of the supply
Table 5.E Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements
The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key
judgements. Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will
monitor a broad range of variables to assess the degree to
which the risks are crystallising. The table below shows

Inflation Report May 2018 Section 5 Prospects for inflation 35
side of the economy, supply is expected to grow at a slower
pace than was typical prior to the financial crisis.
The MPC continues to judge that very little spare capacity
remains in the economy. Although growth is estimated to
have slowed sharply in Q1, this estimate is likely to be revised
up a little over time (Section 2). Moreover, to the extent that
weakness in activity reflected the disruptive impact of adverse
weather, it is unlikely to have had any significant effect on the
degree of spare capacity. Other indicators of slack, such as
unemployment, do not point to any reduction in capacity
pressures.
Over the forecast period, supply growth remains modest by
historical standards at around 1½% a year. Within that, labour
supply growth, which boosted supply growth during the
economic recovery, is projected to slow a little further. That
slowing in part reflects lower net inward migration flows, in
line with ONS projections. Offsetting that, structural
productivity growth is projected to pick up a little.
Since the financial crisis, productivity growth has been
subdued in the United Kingdom, as in many other economies.
Weakness in investment has led to slow growth in the capital
stock — a key driver of productivity growth. Moreover, the
efficiency with which companies use their capital and labour
to produce output also seems to have been rising only slowly.
One influence on UK productivity is the anticipation of, and
response to, post-Brexit trading relationships. That is likely to
have weighed on investment. Over the forecast period, growth
in productivity is projected to be a little faster than its average
in recent years (Chart 5.5) as increases in investment begin to
feed through, but is expected to remain around half the rate
seen before the financial crisis.
The extent of the recovery in productivity growth remains
very uncertain. On the downside, as set out in the MPC’s
latest evaluation of its forecast performance (see Box 5),
productivity growth has continued to disappoint over the
past year and may well do so again. On the upside, annual
productivity growth has averaged 2% over many decades and
it could pick up by more than expected. For example, the rise
in job-to-job flows could lead to better diffusion of ideas and
skills between companies, raising productivity growth.
Conditional on market interest rate expectations of three
25 basis point rises in Bank Rate over the forecast period,
demand is projected to grow a little faster than potential
supply over the forecast period. As in February, a small margin
of excess demand emerges by early 2020 and builds
thereafter, putting upward pressure on domestic inflation
(Key Judgement 4).

Key Judgement 4: with demand outstripping potential
supply, domestic inflationary pressures continue to build
while the contribution from energy and import prices
dissipates further
CPI inflation has fallen back from its recent peak, and by
more than expected at the time of the February Report.
That largely reflects lower-than-expected inflation rates
across a range of import-intensive CPI components. In
addition, import prices have risen by slightly less than had
been expected following the depreciation of sterling. In
previous Reports, all of that shortfall in import prices was
projected to be made up over the forecast period. But, with
more signs that may not be happening (Section 4), the
MPC now judges that import prices will rise by less
(Chart 5.6). As a result, the contribution of import prices
to CPI inflation diminishes more quickly than in the
February projection.
Partially offsetting the decline in the contribution from
import prices in the near term, there is a modest rise in the
contribution of energy to CPI inflation over the next
six months. Higher oil prices are passed through to retail
petrol prices and recently announced tariff rises by some
domestic energy suppliers take effect with other providers
assumed to follow suit. The downward-sloping oil futures
curve, on which the forecast is conditioned, means,
however, that the contribution from energy prices is below
average in the second half of the forecast period. In the
later years of the forecast period, those below-average
contributions broadly offset the positive contribution from
import prices.
Where inflation eventually settles depends mainly on
domestic inflationary pressures. These have been weak in
recent years, reflecting the degree of spare capacity in the
economy. The drag from slack has been most apparent in
the subdued pace of wage growth since the financial crisis.
Over the past year, wage growth has started to pick up
gradually as the labour market has tightened further:
unemployment has fallen to around its equilibrium rate;
recruitment difficulties have risen; and people are moving
between jobs at a similar rate to that before the crisis
(Section 3). Although total pay growth was a little weaker
than assumed in the February Report, that reflected lower
bonus payments. Regular pay growth rose to just under
3%, as expected in February (Section 4). Pay deals seem to
be picking up, broadly consistent with the results of the
Bank’s Agents’ annual pay survey reported in February.
Wage growth is likely to rise gradually over the forecast
period as excess demand builds. As in February, that
pushes up growth in unit labour costs — the cost to
companies of employing someone relative to productivity.
With productivity growth remaining below rates typically
seen before the crisis, pay growth needs to be
commensurately lower than its pre-crisis average for unit

labour cost growth to be consistent with meeting the
inflation target.
Conditional on market interest rates, domestic inflationary
pressures are projected to build over the forecast period
while the contribution from energy and import prices
dissipates. In the central projection, CPI inflation is judged
likely to settle around the 2% target from mid-2020
(Chart 5.7).
5.2 The projections for demand,
unemployment and inflation
Based on these judgements, under the market path for
Bank Rate and the assumption of an unchanged stock of
purchased assets, the MPC projects four-quarter
GDP growth to pick up to 1¾% over the next year and
remain there throughout the forecast period (Table 5.F).
That projection is weaker than in February in the near term,
reflecting the weak Q1 outturn, but similar further out
(Chart 5.8) once that weakness has dropped out of the
four-quarter rate. Within demand, consumption growth is
projected to remain well below past average rates. But
strong global growth, together with the lower level of
sterling, supports net trade and investment. There is
particular uncertainty around the near-term outlook given
the weakness in activity indicators in Q1 both in the
United Kingdom and abroad. The risks around the projection
are judged to be balanced, rather than skewed to the upside
as in February, reflecting more balanced risks around the
global outlook.
As set out in the February Report, the Committee judges
that the economy’s supply capacity is likely to grow at a
relatively modest pace of 1½% over the forecast period.
Unemployment is projected to fall a little further
(Chart 5.9) and the economy moves into excess demand
by early 2020.

Above-target inflation since early 2017 entirely reflects the
impact of higher import prices following sterling’s
depreciation and rises in energy prices. Inflation has fallen
back from 3% to 2½% since late 2017. Inflation is projected
to fall further over this year, before settling at the 2% target
around mid-2020. The contribution from import prices to
inflation is lower throughout the projection, fully
accounting for the modest downward revision to the
inflation projection in the medium term (Table 5.G). As
in February, domestic inflationary pressures build to rates
consistent with the 2% target over the forecast period. The
risks around the inflation projection remain balanced
(Chart 5.10).

The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b). The coloured bands have the same
interpretation as in Chart 5.1, and portray 90% of the probability distribution. The calibration of this
fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is
judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on
unemployment in successive quarters. The fan begins in 2018 Q1, a quarter earlier than the fan for
CPI inflation. That is because Q1 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in part on data
for January and February. The unemployment rate was 4.2% in the three months to February, and is
projected to be 4.2% in Q1 as a whole. A significant proportion of this distribution lies below
Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment rate. There is therefore
uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart.

at 0.5% throughout the three years of the forecast period,
before it rises towards the market path over the subsequent
three years. Under that path, GDP growth is stronger and
inflation ends the forecast period above the target.

Box 5
How has the economy evolved relative to the
February 2017 Report?
The MPC regularly assesses how the economy has evolved
relative to its forecasts. This box looks at how recent
developments in GDP growth, the labour market and inflation
compare to the projections in the February 2017 Report
(Chart A) and what the MPC has learnt from the evolution of
the economy over that period.
The MPC’s forecasts use conditioning assumptions for a
number of variables, such as Bank Rate, the sterling ERI and
US dollar oil prices. As such, when evaluating forecast
performance it is important to abstract from the news
introduced by those conditioning assumptions.(1) Relative to
the February 2017 projections, dollar oil prices are 17% higher
than assumed, and the yield curve and sterling ERI are also
slightly higher than assumed (Table 1).
The February 2017 Report forecast
In the February 2017 Report, four-quarter GDP growth was
projected to slow gradually over 2017 (Panel 1 of Chart A).
That reflected slowing consumption growth as households
adjusted their spending to lower real income growth, driven
largely by the past fall in sterling and the resulting rise in
consumer prices. Business investment was expected to be
broadly flat as uncertainty around the impact of Brexit
continued to weigh on companies’ spending. Offsetting that
to some degree, the fall in sterling, along with a recovery in
global activity growth, was projected to support exports and,
in turn, boost the contribution from net trade. Taken together,
the composition of demand was expected to rotate away from
consumption growth and towards net trade.
CPI inflation was projected to rise above the 2% target,
reaching 2.7% at the end of 2017 (Panel 2 of Chart A), almost
entirely due to the fall in sterling feeding through to consumer
prices. Although past falls in unemployment were expected to
feed through to higher wage growth, domestic inflationary
pressures were expected to remain relatively subdued in 2017
as some degree of spare capacity in the economy remained.
For instance, the unemployment rate was projected to be
stable at around 5% (Panel 3 of Chart A), above its
equilibrium rate, which had been revised down to 4½% at the
time of the February 2017 Report.
GDP growth has slowed broadly as expected in 2017
GDP growth has slowed since 2016 Q4, and was estimated to
have been 2.0% in the five quarters to 2018 Q1 once the
expected upward revision to the ONS data captured in the
backcast is taken into account. That slowing was broadly in
line with the February 2017 projection, and within the central
bands of the MPC’s fan chart (Chart A).
Growth has, however, been stronger than expected
immediately following the referendum. In August 2016, the
MPC had projected that GDP growth would slow sharply
(Table 2), based on a range of indicators available at the time.
Although growth did slow, it did not do so by as much as
projected, in part as uncertainty probably weighed on
(1) For more on the role of conditioning assumptions, see ‘Evaluating forecast
performance’, Independent Evaluation Office, November 2015.

consumer spending by less than expected. In following
quarters, the MPC adjusted its forecasts in response to these
developments and at a faster pace than other forecasters on
average (Chart B).(2) Relative to those more recent projections,
the latest outturn for 2017 has been broadly in line.
Nevertheless, growth remains weaker than had been projected
before the referendum in the May 2016 Report, which was
conditioned on remaining in the EU.
Demand has rotated to a greater degree than
anticipated
Although demand growth has slowed broadly in line with the
February 2017 Report forecast, its composition has rotated to
a greater degree than had been anticipated. Net trade —
already expected to contribute positively to growth over much
of the forecast — boosted GDP growth by more (Table 1).
And business investment growth also picked up by more than
expected, although it remained weak relative to past
expansions (Section 2). By contrast, consumption growth
slowed by more than expected.
A significant driver of the additional rotation in demand
growth has been stronger-than-expected global activity.

has been ¾ percentage point stronger than projected in
February 2017, pushing up external demand for UK goods
and services (Table 1). That has been reflected in
stronger-than-expected gross trade flows, particularly exports.
Business investment growth is also likely to have been
supported by the stronger global environment, in part as a
result of more supportive global financial conditions.
Weaker-than-expected household spending growth has largely
reflected lower-than-expected real income growth, such that
the change in the saving ratio has been broadly as expected
(Table 1). That slowing in consumption growth is despite more
supportive financial conditions — falls in bank funding spreads
and greater competition between banks, for example, led to
narrower-than-expected mortgage spreads over 2017
(Section 1), even as reference rates rose ahead of the increase
in Bank Rate in November.
Supply growth has been weaker and the degree of
spare capacity narrower than expected
While aggregate demand has evolved broadly as expected,
potential supply growth is estimated to have slowed by more
than expected. That has reflected weaker-than-expected
potential productivity, with slower-than-expected growth in
output per hour judged to have reflected slower underlying
productivity growth.
Partly offsetting that, potential labour supply appears to have
been greater than anticipated. As part of its annual assessment
of aggregate supply-side conditions, set out in the
February 2018 Report, the MPC revised down its estimate of
the equilibrium unemployment rate to 4¼% from 4½%. That
judgement, to a large degree, reflected downside news in wage
growth, which remained subdued (Table 1), alongside a further
fall in the unemployment rate (Chart A).
With potential supply growth weaker than expected but
demand growth more in line, slack has been eroded more
quickly than expected. As a result, in 2018 Q1 there is
judged to have been a little less spare capacity than
anticipated at the time of the February 2017 Report, while
unemployment was around its equilibrium rate, rather than
a little above it.
Higher oil prices have pushed up inflation, but
non‑fuel import price growth has been slightly less
than expected
CPI inflation was 2.7% in 2018 Q1, in line with expectations at
the time of the February 2017 Report, but peaked at a higher
rate during 2017 (Chart A). Much of that upside news can be
attributed to higher-than-expected energy prices, reflecting
rises in dollar oil prices (Table 1), in part as global demand
strengthened.
The main driver of above-target inflation has been the
effect of the rise in import prices following the substantial
depreciation in sterling over 2016. Import price growth
has, however, been somewhat less than anticipated
(Table 1).
Domestic cost pressures have been broadly in line with the
February 2017 projection. Although wage growth has been
weaker than anticipated, that weakness has in part been
accounted for by weaker productivity growth. As a result,
unit labour cost growth has been closer to expectations
than wage growth (Table 1).
Implications for the MPC’s projections
Overall, growth and inflation have developed broadly as
expected in the February 2017 Report, and the key
judgements underpinning those forecasts have been borne
out in the main developments in the UK economy over this
period (Table 2). GDP growth has slowed and the
composition of demand has rotated, albeit to a greater
degree than anticipated, largely reflecting stronger global
growth. Although slower supply growth has meant a more
rapid narrowing in spare capacity, the slightly faster pickup
in CPI inflation has largely reflected external factors,
particularly a rise in global energy prices.
These developments are reflected in the key judgements
underpinning the MPC’s May 2018 forecasts (Section 5).
Consumption growth is still projected to remain subdued
relative to historical norms, with a positive contribution
from net trade and a pickup in investment growth
offsetting that to a degree. Gross trade flows have been
stronger than projected over 2017 and are expected to
grow a little faster over coming years than previously
assumed. The economy’s potential supply capacity — or
‘speed limit’ — is expected to remain modest relative to
historical averages, in part as productivity growth picks up
only modestly. Inflation is expected to continue to fall back
as the upward pressure from external cost pressures
diminishes, although a little more quickly than previously
anticipated, reflecting the smaller-than-expected rise in
import prices.
Outturns relative to the MPC’s fan charts
One way of assessing the significance of economic news is
by comparing outturns against the MPC’s fan charts over
time. The 2018 Q1 outturns for GDP growth and CPI
inflation were well within the central band of the
February 2017 fan charts (Charts A, C and D). If the
fan charts accurately describe the uncertainty faced by the
MPC then, absent any news in the conditioning paths,
outturns would be expected to lie evenly across the
fan chart distribution over time, with 10% of outcomes in
each decile.

Box 6
Other forecasters’ expectations
This box reports the results of the Bank’s most recent survey
of external forecasters, carried out in April.(1) On average,
respondents expected four-quarter GDP growth to pick up to
1.7% in three years’ time (Table 1). While this was broadly
unchanged relative to expectations in February, it is somewhat
lower than in May 2016. After the EU referendum, the average
probability that forecasters attached to growth below 1%
three years ahead rose sharply and has remained elevated,
while the probability of growth above 3% has declined
steadily (Chart A). Despite the recent fall in the
unemployment rate to 4.2%, external forecasters, on average,
had continued to expect it to rise over the next three years.
External forecasters’ central expectations for CPI inflation at
all horizons were broadly unchanged relative to three months
ago. The average central expectation at the one-year horizon
has fallen sharply over the past year (Chart B), slightly
faster than the equivalent Inflation Report forecasts. The
average central expectation for inflation in three years’ time
was, at 1.9%, slightly below the MPC’s 2% inflation target.
External forecasters, on average, expected somewhat less
monetary stimulus than they did at the time of the
February Report: the average expectation for Bank Rate was
around 0.3 percentage points higher over the next three years.
The average central expectation for Bank Rate in three years’
time remained, however, below its level in early 2016
(Chart C). As in February, almost all forecasters expected the
current stock of gilt and corporate bond purchases to remain
unchanged over the next three years.
