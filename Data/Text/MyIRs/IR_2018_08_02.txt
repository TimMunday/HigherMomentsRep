Inflation Report
August 2018
On 16 October 2018, the footnote for Chart D on page 19 was amended to read: ‘Wealth decile defined by total gross financial
wealth.’ The footnote previously read ‘Wealth decile defined by total net financial wealth as defined in Chart A.’
In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.
Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy,
including its objectives for growth and employment.
The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of
the Monetary Policy Committee. It serves two purposes. First, its preparation provides a
comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid
to our decision-making. Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the
reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect.
Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are
based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths
for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central
projections.
This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with
section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Inflation Report August 2018 Monetary Policy Summary i
Monetary Policy Summary
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the
2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its
meeting ending on 1 August 2018, the MPC voted unanimously to increase Bank Rate by
0.25 percentage points, to 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock
of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the
issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to
maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central
bank reserves, at £435 billion.
Since the May Inflation Report, the near-term outlook has evolved broadly in line with the MPC’s expectations. Recent
data appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the
second quarter. The labour market has continued to tighten and unit labour cost growth has firmed.
The MPC’s updated projections for inflation and activity are set out in the August Inflation Report and are broadly similar
to its projections in May.
In the MPC’s central forecast, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, GDP is
expected to grow by around 1¾% per year on average over the forecast period. Global demand grows above its
estimated potential rate and financial conditions remain accommodative, although both are somewhat less supportive of
UK activity over the forecast period. Net trade and business investment continue to support UK activity, while
consumption grows in line with the subdued pace of real incomes.
Although modest by historical standards, the projected pace of GDP growth over the forecast is slightly faster than the
diminished rate of supply growth, which averages around 1½% per year. The MPC continues to judge that the UK
economy currently has a very limited degree of slack. Unemployment is low and is projected to fall a little further. In the
MPC’s central projection, therefore, a small margin of excess demand emerges by late 2019 and builds thereafter, feeding
through into higher growth in domestic costs than has been seen over recent years.
CPI inflation was 2.4% in June, pushed above the 2% target by external cost pressures resulting from the effects of
sterling’s past depreciation and higher energy prices. The contribution of external pressures is projected to ease over the
forecast period while the contribution of domestic cost pressures is expected to rise. Taking these influences together,
and conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, CPI inflation remains slightly
above 2% through most of the forecast period, reaching the target in the third year.
The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of
households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal.
The Committee judges that an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points is warranted at this meeting.
The Committee also judges that, were the economy to continue to develop broadly in line with its Inflation Report
projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation
sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon. Any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual
pace and to a limited extent.
Inflation Report August 2018 Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 1
1 Global economic and financial
market developments
The outlook for global activity appears to have moderated slightly and financial conditions have
tightened somewhat, particularly in emerging market economies. Growth is expected to remain
relatively robust, however. UK financial conditions have tightened slightly, but remain
accommodative overall.
Global GDP growth is estimated to have remained broadly
stable in 2018 Q2, a little weaker than expected at the time of
the May Report, having dipped slightly in Q1 (Table 1.A).
Although growth in the US was stronger than expected,
activity was somewhat weaker elsewhere.
Indicators suggest that the outlook for global growth has
moderated slightly, though remains relatively robust. There
are signs of slowing in manufacturing and export-focused
sectors (Chart 1.1). Consistent with that, growth in global
trade and capital goods orders have also declined (Chart 1.2).
Most indicators of activity, however, remain above past
averages. Global demand growth is expected to remain at a
little under ¾% on a UK trade-weighted basis in Q3,
continuing to outstrip potential supply growth.
The resulting gradual absorption of spare capacity in many
countries should lead to a rise in inflationary pressures. Having
been subdued in recent years, wage growth has picked up in
both the US and the euro area (Chart 1.3). Higher oil prices
over the past year (Chart 1.4) have also pushed up inflation.
Although spot oil prices are broadly unchanged in dollar terms
since the May Report, they are around 55% higher than a year
ago. That rise in prices largely reflects subdued oil supply,
which has been broadly flat since 2016, despite continued oil
demand growth. As a result, in 2018 Q1, oil inventories in the
US fell to their lowest level since 2015. The rise in oil prices is
projected to push up world export price inflation in the near
term.
Diminishing spare capacity and rising inflation will have
implications for monetary policy. In the US, the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) has continued to tighten policy
(Section 1.2). Monetary policy in a number of emerging market
economies (EMEs) has also been tightened modestly, as
central banks in those countries have responded to the
resulting appreciation in the US dollar and reduced demand
for EME assets (Section 1.3).
Monetary policy is one factor that has tightened global
financial conditions. A summary measure of financial

conditions suggests that, having eased substantially during
2016–17 as investor confidence and risk appetite rose,
conditions have tightened over 2018 so far (Chart 1.5).
Financial conditions remain accommodative, however, relative
to past averages. Within that, conditions in emerging markets
have tightened by more than elsewhere, and so activity is
likely to be dampened in those countries most (Section 1.3). In
the UK, the slight tightening in financial conditions will push
up the cost of financing for households and businesses
modestly (Section 1.4).
In addition to monetary policy, some of the tightening in
financial conditions appears to reflect a rise in geopolitical
uncertainty, with market contacts reporting a modest
deterioration in global risk sentiment among investors. There
were sharp falls in Italian asset prices following political
developments there, although other euro-area asset prices
were less affected. There are also signs of rising trade
protectionism globally. Tariffs applied by the US on
US$50 billion of Chinese imports, to go alongside the
aluminium and steel tariffs announced earlier in the year,
have been met with reciprocal measures. And around
US$200 billion of Chinese goods have been identified by the
US as potentially subject to further tariffs.
Uncertainty around tariffs and the resulting impact on trade
has led to falls in some equity indices, particularly in emerging
markets. Some non-oil commodity prices have also fallen,
particularly for metals (Chart 1.4), which market contacts
report reflected concern around the effect of higher trade
tariffs on demand. However, that uncertainty has not yet been
reflected in indicators of consumer and business confidence
which, on the whole, have remained relatively robust in the
euro area and US (Chart 1.6).
Tighter financial conditions are likely to dampen growth, as are
greater barriers to trade. The direct impact of the higher tariffs
that have been implemented or proposed on bilateral trade
between the US and China and any associated reciprocal
measures, as well as wider aluminium and steel tariffs, will
weigh somewhat on activity in those countries in coming
quarters, and elsewhere to a modest extent. Moreover, the
prospect of a further escalation in trade protectionism —
particularly if business and consumer confidence and financial
conditions were to deteriorate materially — could weigh
further on the global outlook.(1)
Overall, global growth is expected to remain relatively robust
over the next year (Table 1.B), gradually pushing up inflation.
That pace of growth, however, is a little slower than projected
at the time of the May Report, reflecting slightly tighter
financial conditions and some direct effects from higher trade
tariffs (Section 5).

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 3
1.1 The euro area
Quarterly GDP growth in the euro area averaged 0.4% during
the first half of the year (Table 1.A). That was lower than
anticipated in May and lower than in 2017, when growth
averaged 0.7%. That slowdown probably partly reflected
temporary factors, including adverse weather in some
northern European countries in Q1, particularly Germany and
France. And the synchronicity of the slowdown in demand in
Q1 globally — reflected in weak export growth — may have
pushed up inventories that quarter, so companies may not
have had to increase output in Q2 to meet final demand, even
as it recovered.
Underlying demand growth in the euro area appears to have
remained relatively robust, however. Quarterly consumption
growth was 0.5% in Q1, a little stronger than 2017 rates, while
both consumer and business confidence remained strong. That
should support euro-area activity in coming quarters.
The strength of demand growth over the past two years has
steadily reduced the degree of slack in the euro area, but some
spare capacity is judged to remain. The unemployment rate, at
8.3% in June (Chart 1.7), is above its estimated equilibrium
rate — the rate consistent with stable wage pressures. As set
out in the November 2017 Report, that equilibrium rate is
likely to have fallen in recent years, reflecting the impact of
labour market reforms in a number of countries. Consistent
with that, although wage growth has picked up since 2016
(Chart 1.3), unit labour cost growth has not increased to the
same degree. Core inflation has also remained relatively
subdued (Table 1.C). Taken together, that suggests that the
economy is still operating some way below full potential.
The European Central Bank (ECB) made no changes to its
policy rates in June or July, and provided guidance in June that
rates were expected to remain at present levels at least
through the summer of 2019. The ECB also announced an
extension to its asset purchase programme to December 2018,
at a slower rate of €15 billion per month, reduced from
€30 billion currently, and anticipated an end to net purchases
after that date, subject to incoming data.
The announcement in June led to a shift down in the
market-implied path for policy rates (Chart 1.8), while
longer-term interest rates also fell slightly (Chart 1.9). Despite
the lower path for policy rates, financial conditions in the
euro area are a little tighter than in May, in part reflecting the
slight deterioration in global risk sentiment. Euro-area equity
prices are slightly lower (Chart 1.10) while euro-denominated
corporate bond spreads have widened (Chart 1.11).
With underlying demand growth still relatively robust,
quarterly euro-area activity growth should pick up slightly in

the second half of 2018, to around ½% on average. That
outlook is slightly weaker than was projected at the time of
the May Report, in part reflecting tighter financial conditions,
the moderation in global activity and small spillover effects
from tariff increases on US-China bilateral trade. These factors
are expected to weigh particularly on net trade, which had
contributed substantially to euro-area growth in 2017.
1.2 The United States
In contrast to the euro area, activity in the US — the UK’s
second largest trading partner — rebounded strongly from a
dip in growth in Q1, expanding by 1% in Q2. As expected,
consumption growth rose in Q2 (Chart 1.12), probably
reflecting the delayed timing of personal tax refunds shifting
spending from Q1 into Q2. The recovery in activity was
stronger than expected in May though, driven by a bigger
contribution from net trade. That largely reflected erratically
strong export growth in certain sectors.
GDP growth is expected to fall back in Q3 as the erratic boost
from net trade unwinds, but to remain robust at around ¾%
(Table 1.B). Activity will be supported thereafter by fiscal
policy, following the personal and corporate tax cuts
announced in December 2017, as well as the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2018, which lifted discretionary spending caps by
around US$300 billion over 2018 and 2019, equivalent to
around 1.5% of GDP. Offsetting that slightly, the higher tariffs
that have been implemented or proposed on US trading
partners, including China, and associated reciprocal measures,
will weigh somewhat on activity growth.
Strong demand growth in recent years has absorbed spare
capacity in the US economy, with little, if any, slack remaining.
Employment growth has remained solid and the
unemployment rate fell in 2018 Q2 to 4.0%, around its lowest
level since 2000. Other measures of labour market slack, such
as underemployment and the rate at which employees are
voluntarily leaving jobs, are around their pre-crisis levels. As
the labour market has tightened, annual wage growth has
risen (Chart 1.3), which is likely to have contributed to a
pickup in core inflation (Table 1.C).
Reflecting the robust outlook for demand and rising inflation,
the FOMC has continued to tighten policy, raising the target
range for the federal funds rate to between 1¾% and 2% in
June. The median projection of FOMC members for the federal
funds rate at end-2018 also rose from 2.1% to 2.4%, implying
two further 25 basis point increases in 2018, with a further
three projected in 2019. That is a slightly steeper path for
policy than implied by market prices (Chart 1.8).
As announced in September 2017, the Federal Reserve has
continued to reduce its balance sheet by not replacing a
proportion of maturing assets. By late July, the balance sheet

had shrunk by around US$170 billion. Reduced reinvestment
of past asset purchases, together with the prospect of rises in
US government debt issuance following recent tax reforms,
could put some upward pressure on longer-term interest rates.
Longer-term rates have not yet picked up materially
(Chart 1.9), however, and remain close to historically low
levels. That may reflect the offsetting effect of FOMC
communications, which have emphasised that, to the extent
that a shrinking balance sheet tightens monetary conditions,
the federal funds rate would be commensurately lower.(2)
Recent capital flows into safe assets in the US as global risk
sentiment has deteriorated may also have put downward
pressure on longer-term rates. And, as discussed in Box 6,
slower-moving structural factors, such as demographics, are
likely to continue to weigh on global long-term interest rates
for some time.
The FOMC’s gradual policy tightening has begun to feed
through to US financial conditions. Rates on shorter-term
consumer credit have risen steadily, although the cost of
mortgages — the majority of which are fixed for 30 years
— has picked up by less, consistent with the more limited rise
in longer-term rates. Since the May Report, US equity prices
have risen (Chart 1.10), however, while corporate bond
spreads have been broadly unchanged (Chart 1.11),
contrasting with asset price moves elsewhere. Market contacts
suggest that higher interest rates and the robust US growth
outlook have led to a strengthening of the US dollar which has
appreciated by around 5% over the same period on a
trade-weighted basis (Chart 1.13).
1.3 Emerging market economies
In aggregate, GDP growth in China and other EMEs has
remained relatively robust. The outlook for growth, however,
is a little weaker than in the May Report (Table 1.B). The
growing prospect of trade protectionism has contributed to
falls in equity and corporate bond prices in some countries
according to market contacts, which will weigh on activity to
some degree. And US monetary policy tightening has also led
to a tightening in EME financial conditions.
China
Having slowed slightly in Q1, quarterly GDP growth in China
increased to 1.8% in Q2 (Table 1.A), a stronger pickup than
expected in May. The prospect of rising barriers to trade with
the US has weighed on asset prices however. The Shanghai
Composite equity index is 9% lower than at the time of the
May Report (Chart 1.10) and the renminbi has depreciated
(Chart 1.13), driven by a 6% fall against the US dollar. The
direct impact of tariff changes that have been implemented or
proposed so far is judged to weigh on the outlook for activity
but that effect is likely to be relatively small.

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 6
Expansionary fiscal policy and continued robust credit growth
are expected to support activity in the near term. Survey
indicators, such as the Caixin composite PMI, point to
continued robust growth. And measures of consumer and
business confidence have remained stable in recent months.
As discussed in the June Financial Stability Report, however,
there remain challenges for the Chinese authorities in
maintaining current rates of GDP growth while reducing risks
to financial stability. A sharp slowdown in China could have a
material impact on the UK, both directly and indirectly
through trade and financial linkages, and that effect could be
amplified by large exchange rate and asset price reactions.(3)
Non-China emerging market economies
As a whole, activity growth across non-China EMEs was
broadly stable in 2018 Q1, but with differences between
countries. A slowdown in some countries, such as Brazil and
Indonesia, was offset by stronger growth elsewhere. Survey
indicators, such as Markit PMIs, have fallen slightly, however,
and point to a slowdown in aggregate activity growth in the
near term. Non-China EMEs in aggregate account for around
18% of UK trade and, as discussed in the Financial Stability
Report, disruption in those economies could also have a
material impact on the UK via financial conditions and
spillovers through other advanced economies.
One factor that is likely to weigh on non-China EME growth
over coming quarters is the tightening in US monetary policy.
EME financial conditions tend to be sensitive to US financial
conditions, in part as some EMEs have high levels of
government or corporate debt denominated in dollars. Around
26% of non-China EME non-financial corporate debt is
dollar denominated, equivalent to around 12% of nominal GDP,
with particularly large concentrations in South America and
Turkey. Unless borrowers have revenues in US dollars, or have
hedged themselves against exchange rate moves, those debts
become costlier to service if the US dollar appreciates, as it has
done against nearly all major EME currencies in 2018 so far.
In addition, absent a change in policy rates in EMEs, tighter
US policy rates will reduce the relative return on EME assets
and, in turn, external demand for those assets. The reduction
in demand for EME assets has been exacerbated by rising trade
uncertainty, with the integration of many EMEs into global
supply chains exposing them to the effects of potential trade
disruption. And in the case of some countries, such as
Argentina, Brazil and Turkey, institutional and political
developments may have further reduced investor demand for
their assets.
Perhaps reflecting that, there was a net outflow of portfolio
capital from EMEs in Q2 (Chart 1.14). EME equity prices have

fallen this year (Chart 1.10), while government and corporate
bond spreads have widened. To support exchange rates and
capital inflows, a number of EME central banks have increased
their policy rates, further tightening financing conditions in
those countries. Overall, EME growth is projected to slow over
2018, as tighter financial conditions weigh on activity. That
tightening in financial conditions, however, follows a period of
substantial easing during 2016–17 (Chart 1.5).
1.4 UK financial conditions
Global developments will affect the UK through their impact
on external demand (Section 2), and by influencing UK asset
prices and the financial conditions facing UK households and
companies. The tightening in global financial conditions has
pushed up the cost of finance in the UK modestly, both in
capital markets and, by raising the cost of bank funding,
through bank lending.
Market interest rates and the exchange rate
At its June meeting, the MPC voted 6–3 to leave Bank Rate
unchanged and unanimously to maintain the stock of
purchased assets. The majority of the MPC judged that,
although news since May had given them greater reassurance
that the softness of activity in 2018 Q1 had been largely
temporary, there was value in seeing how the data continued
to evolve, given signs of a weaker global outlook and
tightening in global financial conditions. As discussed in Box 1,
the MPC also revised its guidance on the level of Bank Rate at
which it would consider starting to reduce the stock of
purchased assets, reducing that level to around 1.5%,
compared to the previous guidance of around 2%.
Since the run-up to the May Report, UK interest rates have
fallen. The market-implied path for Bank Rate in the run-up
to the August Report reached 1.1% in three years’ time, just
over 10 basis points lower relative to May (Chart 1.8). Over
the same period, the sterling ERI was 2½% lower (Chart 1.13),
and 17% below its late-2015 peak. Market contacts suggest
that sterling has remained sensitive to shifts in perceptions of
the UK’s future trading relationships following Brexit and their
implications for the economy.
Corporate capital markets
UK equity prices have picked up slightly (Chart 1.10), as the
depreciation in sterling since the run-up to the May Report
increased the value of profits earned by UK-listed companies’
overseas operations. The depreciation in sterling has been a
significant driver of UK equity prices since the start of 2016,
with the FTSE All-Share index around 25% higher over that
period. The equity prices of predominantly UK-focused
companies are broadly unchanged (Chart 1.10).

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 8
Spreads on corporate bonds — another significant source of
finance for large companies — have widened over the past few
months (Chart 1.11). That has raised the cost of finance,
although, as discussed in the latest Financial Stability Report,
spreads remain at levels comparable with those seen before
the financial crisis. Since the May Report, spreads on sterling
investment-grade and high-yield bonds have risen by around
15 basis points and 60 basis points respectively, while spreads
on euro-denominated bonds — an important funding market
for UK companies — have widened to a similar degree.
Alongside shifts in global risk sentiment, market contacts have
cited a number of additional drivers of the recent widening in
bond spreads including the prospective end of the ECB’s
corporate bond purchase programme and recent US corporate
tax reform, which has encouraged share buybacks among
US companies and may have reduced demand for
European debt.
Retail interest rates
Global developments can also affect bank borrowing costs for
households and corporates, primarily by affecting the cost of
wholesale bank funding. Spreads on bank debt funding have
picked up materially over 2018 (Chart 1.15), back to around
their average level since 2014. In part, that rise appears to
have been driven by the same factors that have pushed up
spreads in corporate bond markets more generally. In addition,
as discussed in the latest Financial Stability Report, stronger
bank debt issuance than in recent years, in part as banks look
to meet incoming regulatory requirements, has also added to
the upward pressure on funding spreads.
The cost of wholesale funding is one factor affecting the rates
that banks are willing to pay on retail deposits. Deposit rates
have picked up alongside wholesale funding spreads in recent
months (Chart 1.15). Some quoted deposit rates, in particular
on shorter-term products, remain lower than they were in
2016 however (Table 1.D). As discussed in Box 4 of the
February Report, those shorter-term deposit rates were some
way below Bank Rate prior to the crisis and so as Bank Rate
subsequently fell to very low levels, deposit rates fell by less.
As such, since the rise in Bank Rate in November, the
corresponding rise in deposit rates has been somewhat less, as
the spread between deposit rates and Bank Rate has begun to
return to more normal levels.
Borrowing rates facing households have remained relatively
low, though some mortgage rates have picked up slightly in
recent months (Table 1.D). Higher bank funding spreads,
alongside the upward-sloping market-implied path for interest
rates, are likely to push up household borrowing rates in the
near term. The strength of competition in the retail banking
market in the face of relatively subdued demand for household
credit has pushed down lending rates in recent years, with
lenders reducing margins on some products to maintain
market share. Lenders noted in recent discussions that,

although further compression as a result of competition was
unlikely, margins on lending were not expected to pick up
materially.
For companies, bank borrowing rates have been broadly stable
since May (Table 1.D), having picked up gradually since August
last year as rises in short-term market interest rates were
passed through to lending rates. As most lending to companies
is agreed at a floating rate, those rises were passed through
fairly quickly to the stock of corporate borrowing.
Box 1
Monetary policy since the May Report
The MPC’s central projection in the May Report was for GDP
to grow by around 1¾% per year on average over the forecast
period. While modest by historical standards, that growth rate
was slightly faster than the diminished rate of supply growth,
which was projected to average around 1½% per year. As a
result, a small margin of excess demand was projected to
emerge by early 2020, feeding through into higher rates of pay
growth and domestic cost pressures. Nevertheless,
CPI inflation was projected to continue to fall back gradually
as the effects of sterling’s past depreciation faded. Conditional
on the path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates
prevailing at the time, inflation was projected to reach the
2% target in two years.
A key assumption in the MPC’s May projections was that the
dip in output growth in the first quarter of 2018 would prove
temporary. At its meeting ending on 20 June 2018, the MPC
noted that recent data releases had been broadly consistent
with that judgement. A number of indicators of household
spending and sentiment had bounced back strongly,
employment growth had remained solid and surveys of
business activity had been stable. Global activity data had
been mixed, however, and downside risks had increased in
some emerging markets, although the prospects for global
GDP growth remained strong.
CPI inflation had remained unchanged at 2.4% in May. In the
near term, inflation was expected to pick up by slightly more
than projected in the May Report, reflecting higher dollar oil
prices and a weaker sterling exchange rate. Most indicators of
pay growth had picked up over the past year and the labour
market remained tight, suggesting that domestic cost
pressures would continue to firm gradually.
The best collective judgement of the MPC remained that, were
the economy to develop broadly in line with the May Report
projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy would
be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a
conventional horizon. All members agreed that any future
increases in Bank Rate were likely to be at a gradual pace and
to a limited extent.
Six members judged that an increase in Bank Rate was not
required at the June meeting. While the news since the
previous meeting had given these members greater
reassurance that the softness of activity in the first quarter
had been largely temporary, the outlook for global growth had
weakened somewhat and global financial conditions had
tightened. For these members, there was value in waiting to
see how the data evolved.
Three members favoured an immediate increase in Bank Rate
of 25 basis points. These members had a higher degree of
confidence that the slowdown in Q1 was temporary or erratic,
and felt that the most recent labour market indicators
indicated some upside risks to the expected pickup in average
weekly earnings and unit wage costs.
In addition to its discussion of the immediate policy decision,
the MPC reviewed its previous guidance on the level of
Bank Rate at which it would consider whether to start to
reduce the stock of purchased assets. The MPC continues to
expect to maintain the stock of purchased assets until
Bank Rate reaches a level from which it can be cut materially.
Since its previous guidance, however, the MPC had reduced
Bank Rate from 0.5% to 0.25% and had noted that it could be
lowered further if required. Reflecting this, the MPC now
intends not to reduce the stock of purchased assets until
Bank Rate reaches around 1.5%, compared to the previous
guidance of around 2%. Consistent with its previous guidance,
a decision to start reducing the stock of purchased assets
would reflect the economic circumstances at the time.
Inflation Report August 2018 Section 2 Demand and output 10
2 Demand and output
GDP growth is expected to have recovered in 2018 Q2, having slowed temporarily in Q1. Real
income growth is recovering following the effects of sterling’s depreciation, which should support
modest consumption growth. Business investment and net trade should also continue to support
GDP growth, though remain sensitive to the global outlook and the effects of Brexit.
2.1 Near-term outlook
Quarterly GDP growth is estimated to have slowed to 0.2%
in 2018 Q1 (Chart 2.1). That was revised up from 0.1% in the
preliminary estimate and, as set out in the May Report, it is
expected to be revised up further to 0.3% in the mature
estimate.
In May, the MPC judged that growth in Q1 was probably
depressed by around 0.1 percentage points by disruption from
adverse weather. Developments since then have been broadly
consistent with that judgement. For example, according to
Bank calculations based on responses to the ONS Labour
Force Survey, total hours worked were 0.15% lower in Q1 due
to the adverse weather.
GDP growth is expected to have recovered to 0.4% in Q2
(Chart 2.1), as anticipated in May. That is slightly faster than
the estimated growth rate of potential supply — the pace at
which output can grow consistent with balanced inflationary
pressures. Newly introduced ONS estimates of monthly
GDP growth (see Box 2) suggest that growth in the
three months to May was 0.2%. That growth rate continued
to be depressed by the impact of weak activity in March
however, probably due to the adverse weather. By contrast,
monthly growth in April and May averaged ¼%.
The recovery in GDP growth in Q2 is expected to have been
driven by a pickup in consumption growth, to 0.5%
(Section 2.2). A number of indicators of household spending,
including consumer credit growth and property transactions
(Section 2.3), which were weak in Q1, have bounced back since
then, suggesting much of the earlier weakness was erratic. In
addition, retail sales grew by 2.1% in Q2 (Chart 2.2). Although
in the past year the number of retail store closures have
increased and retail footfall has fallen, contacts of the Bank’s
Agents suggest that mainly reflects shifts in consumer demand
to online stores and from goods to services. And although
growth in household money has slowed, that appears to
reflect an unwind of past shifts in demand for different assets
(see Box 3).

Box 2
Implications of changes to the ONS GDP
publication timetable
Following a consultation, the ONS announced improvements
to the coverage of GDP estimates and changes to the timing
of releases. Those changes are beginning to be introduced,
altering the presentation of data for 2018 Q2. This box
discusses how the new GDP release schedule affects the MPC’s
monitoring of the current economic conjuncture. Overall, the
changes have no material implications for the extent of the
information available to the MPC at its policy meetings.
The new ONS timetable
To improve the accuracy and reliability of the first estimate of
GDP, the ONS is delaying the release by two weeks (Figure A),
allowing it to incorporate a greater amount of data. While that
takes publication beyond the timing of Inflation Reports,
another welcome development is that monthly estimates of
output in the service sector — which constitutes around 80%
of the economy — will be published earlier, alongside those for
production and construction. That means output data for the
first two months of the latest quarter will still be available
ahead of each Report, and summarised in a new monthly GDP
time series. While estimates of the third month will not be
available until later, the data content of those in previous
preliminary estimates was significantly lower than for the
other two months.
MPC nowcasts
Since official data are published with a lag, the MPC produces
estimates of the current rate of GDP growth, or ‘nowcasts’.
While such nowcasts are subject to judgement, they are
heavily informed by a range of models.(1) One of these models,
using a mixed‑data sampling (MIDAS) approach, is particularly
suited to nowcasting. This model takes into account a range of
survey and official data, with the weights attached to the
various indicators changing as more data become available.
Early estimates place a high weight on the latest surveys,
which tend to be more timely, with greater emphasis placed
on official data as they become available.
Bank staff nowcasts should provide a good signal for early
estimates of quarterly GDP growth. Testing their past
performance, by feeding in two months of real‑time output
data, suggests that GDP nowcasts using Bank staff’s latest
MIDAS model would have been within 0.1 percentage points
of the ONS’s preliminary estimate on around 80% of
occasions since 2004 (Chart A).
Moreover, GDP data are revised over time as a wider range of
information becomes available and methodological
improvements allow the ONS to measure activity more
accurately. Uncertainty around the profile of GDP growth will,
therefore, continue to exist beyond the release of early
estimates.

into the present: the Bank’s approach to GDP nowcasting’, Bank of England Quarterly
Bulletin, 2017 Q2. Bank staff have since introduced a new MIDAS model, which is
better suited to the ONS’s new publication timetable.

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 2 Demand and output 12
In contrast to consumption, net trade is expected to have
subtracted from growth in Q2, in part due to a fall in goods
exports (Section 2.4). Consistent with that, manufacturing
output has weakened since the start of 2018 (Chart 2.3),
although part of that recent fall could reflect a lagged impact
from the weather‑related disruption in Q1. Companies built up
inventories in the first quarter (Table 2.A), but surveys
suggest that inventories fell back in Q2 and so companies
should need to raise activity to meet further demand growth.
Net trade is projected to contribute positively to growth in
subsequent quarters.
GDP growth is projected to remain at 0.4% in Q3 (Chart 2.1).
Most survey indicators of output remain consistent with
steady growth over the rest of 2018.
2.2 Consumer spending
Consumer spending is determined largely by household
incomes. Household real income growth has been weak since
2016 (Chart 2.4) due to rises in import prices following the
depreciation of sterling associated with the EU referendum
and subdued nominal pay growth over that period. As the
effects of the fall in sterling on inflation fade and nominal pay
growth continues to pick up, real income growth is expected
to be higher than in recent years, supporting consumption
growth (Section 5).
Over the recent past, consumption growth has slowed by less
than real income growth and, as a result, the saving ratio has
fallen since the end of 2015 (Chart 2.4). The extent to which
households choose to save or borrow is likely to depend in
part on the state of their balance sheets, which are relatively
strong compared to the past (see Box 4).
Another factor that can affect how much households spend or
save is their confidence in future income growth. The headline
GfK measure of consumer confidence has been broadly stable
since mid‑2016 (Chart 2.5). Within that, the balance for
households’ expectations of their personal situation, which
tends to be well correlated with spending growth, has risen in
recent months. Consumer confidence is likely to have been
supported by the strength of the labour market (Section 3)
with the latest IHS Markit Household Finance Index suggesting
that job security was around its highest level since the series
began in 2009.
Household spending will also be influenced by interest rates.
First, changes in how much income households receive from
their deposits or are required to pay on their debts will affect
how much they have available to spend. Net savers are
typically less inclined to spend out of a rise in income than net
borrowers and so rises in interest rates tend to depress
spending overall. Second, interest rates can influence how
much of their incomes households choose to save, or how

Box 3
Developments in broad money
Money is the key medium of exchange with which to make
payments for goods and services.(1) As such, money growth
may provide a signal for recent and future trends in activity
and inflation.(2) There are a number of factors that affect the
amount of money in circulation, however, and understanding
why money growth has evolved as it has is important in
assessing what signals to take from it. This box considers
recent developments in broad money — the amount of money
held in bank deposits and as cash in circulation.
Twelve‑month growth in broad money slowed to 3½% in
2018 Q2, having been above 7% in 2016 H2 (Chart A). That
has brought the rate closer to nominal spending growth, which
has also slowed, albeit to a lesser degree. A slowdown in credit
growth since 2016 is likely to have been a contributing factor to
the slowing in money growth as it is the main source of money
creation.(3) Indeed, the two have slowed by a similar extent.
Looking beneath the aggregate data, developments in money
holdings across different sectors of the economy may also
help to highlight trends. Those developments can, however,
also reflect other factors that have limited implications for
spending prospects, which appears to have been the case
recently. And since the sectors are interconnected,
developments in one sector can also spill over to others as
money circulates around the economy.
The slowing in aggregate broad money growth since 2016
largely reflects slower growth in households’ deposits and cash
holdings (Chart B). Household spending growth has slowed at
the same time, albeit by slightly less. Although household
spending and money growth are correlated, other household
indicators (Section 2.2) have statistically been better
predictors of spending, and money balances have provided
little incremental information over and above those.
As discussed in past Reports, the pickup in household money
growth during 2016 occurred alongside a reduction in
households’ investment fund holdings and so appeared to
reflect a desire among households to hold more liquid assets
in the face of heightened uncertainty around the referendum.
The subsequent slowing in household money growth appears
in part to reflect some of that precautionary demand
subsiding, as investment fund holdings have risen. To the
extent that it reflects a shift in demand for different assets, its
effect on money growth is likely to be temporary and to be
less informative about spending prospects.
Private non‑financial companies’ (PNFCs’) deposits have in the
past appeared to be a leading indicator of business investment
growth.(4) Growth in PNFCs’ money holdings has been robust

much they borrow to supplement their income, with higher
interest rates increasing the attractiveness of saving and
reducing that of spending, all else equal.
In the mortgage market, lower bank funding costs and
intensifying competition have led to a reduction in mortgage
rates in recent years. Some households will have benefited
from those low rates either by taking out new mortgages or by
remortgaging, which all else equal will have boosted
household spending. Bank funding costs have risen more
recently (Section 1), however, and are starting to be passed
through to higher mortgage rates.
In consumer credit, there is evidence of a modest tightening in
conditions over the past year. The maximum interest‑free
period on credit card balance transfers and on purchases, on
average across lenders, have both continued to fall, while the
average quoted rate on credit cards has risen. Consumer credit
conditions remain supportive, however, and results from the
latest Bank/NMG survey show that the share of respondents
concerned about their access to credit remains low.
Taking these influences together, consumption is expected to
grow modestly in coming quarters, at around ¼% on average
(Table 2.B), broadly in line with real incomes and supported by
accommodative financial conditions. That outlook is
corroborated by results of a survey of companies on consumer
demand conducted by the Bank’s Agents in May, where
respondents expected stronger consumer income growth and
confidence to drive an acceleration in sales volumes over the
next 12 months.

in recent years, having picked up since 2011 (Chart B). But that
in part appears to have reflected an increase in companies’
desired money holdings — continuing a trend that emerged
prior to the crisis — perhaps for precautionary purposes. As
such, nominal business investment growth continues to be
modest despite that growth in companies’ money holdings.
Nevertheless, those higher balances may provide some
support to future business investment growth.
Money holdings of non‑intermediate financial companies
— covering pension funds and other asset managers — may
influence, as well as be influenced by, asset prices.(5) Many of
the MPC’s asset purchases, announced in August 2016, will
have been bought from asset managers and hence boosted
their money holdings at the time. To the extent that their
money holdings were above desired levels as a result, they
may have bought other assets to rebalance their portfolios,
boosting the prices of those assets.(6) For example, growth in
equity prices appear to have been correlated with growth in
money holdings (Chart B). The impact on equity prices of
those and earlier asset purchases by the Bank are difficult to
detect, however, given the many other factors that affect
them.(7) For example, the decline in the exchange rate during
2016 boosted the sterling value of profits earned in UK‑listed
companies’ overseas operations, and therefore sterling equity
prices (Section 1).
Overall, money growth can be affected by a number of factors
that complicate its relationship with activity and prices.
Underlying trends in money holdings do tend to broadly
coincide with nominal spending, however, and as a timely
indicator of economic developments, the MPC will continue to
monitor them closely alongside other indicators of spending.

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 2 Demand and output 15
2.3 Housing
Developments in the housing market can provide a signal
about household spending more generally. Over the past few
years, activity in the housing market has been broadly stable,
but subdued. Mortgage approvals have been broadly
unchanged since mid-2016 despite low interest rates
(Chart 2.6). Annual house price inflation has slowed since the
start of 2016, by around 5 percentage points, to 2.2% in
2018 Q2 according to the average of lenders’ indices
(Chart 2.7), slower than expected at the time of the
May Report. Consistent with that, official UK data to May
suggest house price inflation has declined to a similar degree.
Rent inflation has also slowed and was around 1% in the year
to 2018 Q2 (Chart 2.8).
That weakness in the housing market appears to be
concentrated in London. In 2018 Q1, mortgage completions
for housemovers and first‑time buyers in London were around
12% lower than in 2016, and house price (Chart 2.7) and rent
inflation (Chart 2.8) have both fallen sharply and are now
negative.
Although developments in London have tended to lead other
areas in the past, if the reasons for the current weakness in
London are fairly idiosyncratic, they may indicate little about
prospects for the UK housing market as a whole. London
house price inflation was particularly strong from 2014–16
(Chart 2.7), reducing affordability. Given its relatively high
level of house prices, London was likely to have been
disproportionately affected by regulatory and tax changes
since 2014. The recent slowing in house prices has brought
London more into line with other areas. The slowing in the
buy‑to‑let market, as mentioned in previous Reports, may
have affected London more than other areas, as London
accounts for a substantial proportion of UK buy‑to‑let activity.
Some of the weakness in the London market may also reflect a
fall in net EU migration (Section 3), alongside wider Brexit
uncertainty. The number of EU nationals in London appears to
have fallen slightly since the EU referendum, although it has
continued to grow in other regions. As EU nationals make up
around 12% of households in London and 20% of the private
rental sector, that fall will affect demand for housing services
and therefore house prices and rents. Alongside that, more
respondents to the RICS housing survey in London than in
other areas reported increased uncertainty about the UK’s
future relationship with the EU and an associated negative
impact on house prices.
In the near term, modest real income growth and
accommodative credit conditions should support housing
market activity. Mortgage approvals are projected to remain
stable and UK house price inflation is expected to pick back up
to a little over 3% by mid‑2019 (Table 2.B).

Developments in the housing market will also contribute to
GDP directly through housing investment. Housing investment
fell by 0.5% in 2018 Q1, but that may in part reflect adverse
weather, which hampered construction activity. Construction
activity is expected to have recovered in Q2, although
contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that capacity
constraints were limiting the extent to which any output lost
in Q1 could be subsequently made up. New housing orders,
which are an indicator of private housing starts and therefore
investment, rose by 19% in 2018 Q1 to their highest level
since the crisis. This will support housing investment over the
rest of the year.
2.4 Net trade and the current account
Net trade contributed positively to GDP growth in 2017 and
continued to do so in 2018 Q1 (Table 2.A). In contrast, net
trade is expected to have subtracted 0.6 percentage points
from GDP growth in Q2. However, the recent fall in part
reflects volatility in net exports of non‑monetary gold, which
do not affect aggregate GDP as they are offset by changes in
the contribution to private sector investment in valuables.
Survey indicators of export growth remain robust (Chart 2.9)
and demand for exports will continue to benefit from
relatively robust global growth (Section 1). The outlook for net
trade will depend on how the supply chains and capacity of
companies, both here and abroad, evolve in response to Brexit
and associated movements in sterling. But net trade is
expected to continue to make a positive contribution to
GDP growth in coming quarters.
The current account deficit — which reflects the balance of
nominal trade flows and other payments between the UK and
the rest of the world — narrowed to 3.4% of GDP in 2018 Q1
(Chart 2.10). That reflected a narrowing in the deficits on both
the trade balance and the primary income balance — the net
value of investment income received by UK residents. Over
2008–17, the trade deficit is estimated to be around 0.4% of
GDP narrower on average than previously estimated. That
reflects revisions to data in Pink Book 2018 following a
methodological change that increased the estimated level of
services exports.
2.5 Business investment
Business investment fell by 0.4% in 2018 Q1 (Table 2.A). That
fall was driven by investment in construction‑related assets,
which may have reflected the effect of adverse weather. Even
looking through that volatility, however, business investment
growth has continued to be weaker in recent years than in
previous recoveries and lower than would be expected given
accommodative financial conditions and relatively robust
global growth.

Some of this recent weakness may reflect the effects of
uncertainty around Brexit. As set out in the May Report, results
from the Bank’s Decision Maker Panel Survey and Deloitte CFO
Surveys at that time suggested that Brexit was becoming less
of a drag on business investment growth. But respondents to
the 2018 Q2 Deloitte CFO Survey again ranked Brexit as the
top risk facing their businesses, and three quarters of
respondents expected Brexit to lead to a deterioration in the
business environment in the long term, the highest proportion
since the referendum.
Weak demand for investment appears to have been reflected
in slowing growth of bank lending to companies since
mid‑2016 (Chart 2.11). There are also signs that financial
conditions have tightened slightly since May which might have
weighed on lending, although conditions remain
accommodative overall (Section 1). Growth in lending to small
and medium‑sized enterprises has been slower than for larger
companies. Results from the Q2 Credit Conditions Survey,
however, suggested that demand for bank lending from small
businesses rose significantly in that quarter.
Larger corporates can also access other sources of finance,
such as the corporate bond market. Net corporate bond
issuance was strong in Q2 (Chart 2.12). Additionally, the
volume of leveraged loans has risen rapidly since early 2017.
But over that period, almost all of those loans have been for
either balance sheet restructuring or mergers and acquisitions
and so are unlikely to have provided much direct support to
business investment growth.
Business investment growth is expected to have picked back
up in Q2 and to remain a little above its past average rate in
coming quarters (Table 2.B), but subdued compared with
previous recoveries. That is consistent with survey measures of
investment intentions. Investment is likely to remain sensitive
to developments in Brexit and the prospects for global growth.
2.6 Government
The MPC’s projections are conditioned on the Government’s
tax and spending plans detailed in the March 2018 Spring
Statement. Under those plans, public sector net borrowing is
projected to fall to 1.3% of GDP by 2020/21, from 2.3% of
GDP in 2017/18.

Household balance sheets
Household real income growth has been weak due to the rise
in import prices following sterling’s depreciation around the
time of the EU referendum and subdued nominal pay growth.
Real incomes have been broadly flat since the start of 2016,
compared to average quarterly growth of ½% during 2012–15.
Consumption growth has not slowed to the same extent as
real income growth and, as a result, the saving ratio has fallen
to historically low levels (Chart 2.4).
A key influence on household spending will be the pace at
which households might seek to build savings in coming years.
That will depend, in part, on the strength of household balance
sheets. Households may be willing to save less if they have
already built up a buffer stock of precautionary saving, or if
the value of their net wealth rises. But they might save more if
they have a low stock of saving and are worried about their
ability to borrow to support consumption, in case of future
loss of income. This box explores developments in household
balance sheets and discusses the potential implications for
savings.
Net wealth and household saving
The stock of households’ financial and housing assets is
considerably larger than their stock of debt. That means, in
aggregate, the household sector holds significant net wealth.
Developments in household balance sheet positions will
reflect patterns of asset and liability accumulation as well as
changes in asset values.
In the decade prior to the financial crisis, net wealth rose
steadily (Chart A) and the saving ratio was broadly stable.
But during the crisis, wealth fell, driven mainly by a fall in
house prices, and the saving ratio rose. Some of that rise in the
saving ratio may have reflected households increasing saving
to offset the fall in wealth. Some of it is also likely to have
reflected the sharp tightening in credit conditions and higher
uncertainty associated with rises in unemployment over that
period.
Since the crisis, net financial wealth has risen by around 60%
(Chart A), credit conditions have loosened, unemployment
has decreased and the saving ratio has fallen back. In
particular, since the end of 2015, net financial wealth has risen
by 12%, in part as the fall in sterling associated with the EU
referendum has boosted the value of equities of companies
with foreign earnings (Section 1), and the saving ratio has
fallen further, to historically low levels.
The extent to which rises in wealth boost consumption and
lower the saving ratio is uncertain and can vary over time.
Bank staff estimate that, on average over the past, a 10% rise
in the real value of households’ financial assets has boosted
consumption by around 0.5%. On that basis, the rise in real
net financial wealth since the end of 2015 could have been
associated with around a ½ percentage point fall in the
saving ratio.
In addition to the rise in financial wealth, housing wealth has
risen by around 12% since the end of 2015 and by around 40%
since the crisis (Chart A). Rises in the value of housing wealth
will increase the value of housing equity that households can
use as collateral against which to borrow. As set out in the box
on pages 18–19 of the November 2016 Report, Bank staff
estimated that for a 10% rise in housing wealth, this collateral
channel was associated with a boost to the level of
consumption averaging around 0.5%.
The distribution of assets and debt across households
The distribution of assets and liabilities across households can
also matter for consumption. In particular, households with
higher levels of debt tend to adjust their spending more
significantly in response to shocks to their income.(1)
Results from the latest Bank/NMG survey suggest that the
proportions of households with high mortgage debt to income
ratios or high debt‑servicing ratios (DSRs) have risen slightly
since 2016, but remain significantly lower than during the
crisis (Chart B). The proportion of households with high DSRs
remains below its pre‑crisis average. In addition, the savings of
households with high DSRs appear to have risen since 2014
(Chart C), which suggests that those households are now
likely to be more resilient to shocks.

Results from the latest Bank/NMG survey also show that more
households with high levels of net financial wealth have
maintained or increased their spending over the past
12 months than less wealthy households (Chart D). While
those households may have seen faster rises in their incomes,
it could suggest that having stronger balance sheets has also
supported their spending.
Conclusion
In aggregate, household balance sheets look relatively strong
compared to the past as the stock of both financial and
housing assets has risen considerably faster than the stock of
debt. That may be supporting the current low saving rate,
allowing households to maintain consumption growth even as
real income growth has slowed.
Alongside that, low unemployment and accommodative
financial conditions should limit households’ perceived need to
build up further precautionary savings in aggregate. As a result,
consumption growth is expected to remain in line with real
income growth over the next few years such that the saving
ratio remains broadly flat (Section 5).

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 3 The labour market and pay 20
3 The labour market and pay
Labour demand growth remains robust and a very limited degree of slack is left in the economy.
Reflecting the tightening in the labour market, indicators of pay growth have been strengthening
and pay growth is projected to rise slightly further. That, combined with subdued productivity
growth, is contributing to rising domestic cost pressures.
Most indicators suggest that labour demand growth has
remained robust and that the labour market is currently tight
(Section 3.1). Pay growth has risen over the past year
(Section 3.2) and tightness in the labour market is expected to
push up pay growth slightly further in coming years
(Section 5). In addition to stronger pay growth, unit labour
cost growth has been boosted by temporarily weak growth in
productivity (Section 3.3). Over coming years, the projected
further strengthening in wage growth raises domestic
inflationary pressures (Section 4).
3.1 Labour market tightness
During the financial crisis, output fell and unemployment rose,
as companies reduced hiring and increased redundancies. The
number of additional hours people wanted to work also rose,
perhaps in response to a squeeze in their real incomes. Taken
together, these factors led to a substantial degree of spare
capacity opening up in the labour market over this period.
This, in turn, was a significant factor behind subdued wage
growth during 2009–15 (Section 3.2).
That spare capacity has now largely been absorbed and the
MPC judges that very limited slack remains (Section 5).
Relative to expectations at the time of the May Report, there
has been little news in labour market quantities. The
participation rate and employment rate were slightly higher,
and average hours slightly lower, than expected. The
unemployment rate was 4.2% in the three months to May
(Chart 3.1). This was broadly in line with the MPC’s judgement
of the equilibrium rate of unemployment of 4¼%,(1)
suggesting little scope for unemployment to fall further
without generating excess wage pressure.
Broader measures also suggest that there is limited spare
capacity in the labour market. In aggregate, the total net
additional hours that people report wanting to work, over and
above the hours they usually work each week, has fallen to
around zero. As discussed in previous Reports, the proportion

of the population who report that they would like a job but are
not currently seeking one — the marginal attachment ratio —
has fallen sharply in recent years (Table 3.A), suggesting that
there is no significant spare capacity among those not actively
looking for a job. The number of vacancies per person in the
labour force — which is an indicator of the difficulty with
which employers would be able to fill jobs — is above its
pre-crisis average. The rate at which those already in
employment are switching to new jobs has risen to close to
pre-crisis rates, although it softened in Q1 (Chart 3.2). And
survey measures of firms’ recruitment difficulties are at or
above pre-crisis levels.
With little slack in the labour market, growth in the size of the
workforce will come mainly from population growth. The
MPC’s forecasts assume that the population evolves in line
with the ONS’s latest principal population projection,
published in October 2017. A key influence on population
growth is net migration to the UK. In the year to
December 2017, net inward migration rose to 282,000,
slightly above the ONS projection. Within this, net migration
from the EU has slowed since 2016 H1. The ONS projects net
inward migration to fall somewhat in coming years
(Chart 3.3), reducing population growth slightly.
The labour market is expected to tighten further in the near
term. Employment has continued to grow solidly (Table 3.A)
and labour demand growth appears robust. The strength of
employment growth over the past few years has been
associated with lower flows out of employment rather than
higher flows into it (Chart 3.2). Within this, the redundancy
rate is around half its pre-crisis average. Many survey
indicators of employment intentions remain above their past
averages and the number of vacancies remains high. As a
result, the unemployment rate is projected to fall to 4.0% in
2018 Q3 (Chart 3.1), broadly as anticipated at the time of the
May Report (Table 3.B).
3.2 Developments in pay growth
A tightening labour market and lower unemployment is
typically associated with higher pay growth (Chart 3.4) as it
becomes more difficult for firms to recruit and retain staff.
Whole-economy regular average weekly earnings (AWE)
growth — which excludes bonuses — rose to 2.7% in the three
months to May from 2.0% a year earlier, broadly as
anticipated.
Wage growth remains subdued relative to its past average,
though much of that weakness is likely to reflect lower
productivity growth than in the past. Labour productivity
— the amount of output produced per worker — is a
significant influence on the amount of revenue that companies
generate, and therefore what they can afford to pay their

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 3 The labour market and pay 22
employees. Therefore, while wage and productivity growth can
deviate in the short run, they have tended to move together
over time. Productivity fell during the financial crisis and its
growth has remained subdued since then (Chart 3.5),
particularly relative to its pre-crisis trend. Four-quarter growth
in output per head is expected to have remained weak in
2018 Q2. Average hours worked tend to be volatile from
one quarter to another, which in turn increases the volatility in
output per hour relative to output per head. Indeed, a sharp
fall in average hours worked since 2017 H1 has led to a
divergence between these two measures of productivity
growth.
Because productivity growth tends eventually to be fully
reflected in wage growth, slower productivity growth can
probably account for around half of the shortfall in average
wage growth since 2010, relative to its pre-crisis average
(Chart 3.6). Productivity growth is projected to pick up a little,
reaching around 1¼% by 2019 — which will support some rise
in wage growth — but it is expected to remain below its past
average rate (Section 5).
The remaining weakness in wage growth is likely to be mainly
due to labour market slack. During much of 2008–17, the
unemployment rate was higher than the MPC’s judgement of
the equilibrium rate of unemployment. While labour market
slack has now largely been absorbed, it can take time for that
to be fully reflected in wage growth.
Data from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings suggest
that pay rises for those switching jobs had increased to
pre-crisis rates, both for those moving to a new employer and
for those moving to a new role with the same employer
(Chart 3.7). Pay rises for those staying in the same job had
remained subdued, however, and would need to increase to
support a broader rise in labour cost pressures. These data are
only available with a lag and the most recent relate to April
2017. Since then, AWE growth has risen and so could suggest
that pay rises have broadened out. Recent evidence from the
Bank’s Agents suggests that recruitment and retention
pressures have pushed up pay growth over the past year (see
Box 5). Contacts that reported recruitment and retention
having become harder over the past 12 months had increased
average pay growth by more than those who reported the
level of difficulty as unchanged.
3.3 The outlook for pay and labour costs
Annual growth in average wages excluding bonuses of 2.7% in
the three months to May 2018 was higher than in 2016, when
growth was around 2½%, and higher still than the average of
around 1¾% a year during 2010–15. It is projected to remain
around 2¾% in the second half of the year, broadly
unchanged since the May Report.

Box 5
Agents’ update on business conditions
The Bank of England’s Agents have a long-standing role in
providing economic intelligence to the Bank’s policymaking
committees from their regular meetings with businesses.
Some of the key information from Agents’ contacts considered
by the Monetary Policy Committee at its August meeting is
highlighted in this box. This replaces the Agents’ summary of
business conditions, previously released a week after the
Inflation Report, which will no longer be published.(1) A
comprehensive quarterly report from the Agents on business
conditions will be published alongside the MPC decision in
non-Inflation Report months.
According to the Bank’s Agents, annual consumer spending
growth rose slightly, supported somewhat by the warmer
weather and the football World Cup.(2) The underlying picture
remained one of modest growth. Retailers reported subdued
demand growth, especially for white goods and homewares,
due to weak real income growth and housing market activity.
There was solid growth in business services activity,
particularly relating to mergers and acquisitions, company
voluntary agreements and Brexit advice.
Growth in domestic manufacturing output eased slightly but
remained above its long-run average. Companies in supply
chains for consumer goods faced headwinds from weaker
demand growth, especially for cars and other big-ticket items,
but demand for manufactured components from the oil and
gas sector improved. Growth in manufacturing export volumes
also eased slightly, but remained above average, and global
demand was firm for aerospace, capital equipment and
construction materials.
Construction output growth edged up, but remained sluggish.
There was some catch-up following weather-related delays in
2018 Q1. However, the recent hot weather also caused
challenges, for example through health and safety
requirements or difficulties working with some materials.
Many contacts faced capacity constraints.
Investment intentions for the next 12 months continued to be
depressed by economic and political uncertainty. Contacts’
references to uncertainty had picked up, with many related to
concerns around Brexit. UK-based subsidiaries of
foreign-owned companies reported holding back investment,
and firms with export markets or with international supply
chains were reluctant to expand capacity until there was more
clarity on future EU market access.
Recruitment difficulties had intensified. Average pay
settlements were a little higher than a year ago, in a range of
2½%–3½%. Growth in total labour costs picked up slightly,
partly as a result of the increase in employers’ pension
auto-enrolment contributions. Increases in non-discretionary
labour costs were reducing the scope for across-the-board pay
rises for some companies.
Agents’ survey on the labour market
In June and July, the Agents surveyed business contacts about
difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff.(3) They asked
companies what actions they were taking to address these
issues, including if there was any impact on pay growth in
2018.
The results suggest that companies found it more difficult to
recruit and retain staff than last year, with around two thirds
of respondents saying it had become harder to recruit and
retain staff with key skills and around 40% reporting increased
difficulties relating to staff for any positions (Chart A).
In response to rising recruitment and retention pressures, the
most frequent action taken was to increase pay (Chart B). A
greater proportion of firms increased pay for key existing staff
than for new recruits or existing staff more generally. Contacts
also reported increasing spending on recruitment, keeping
vacancies open for longer and increasing investment in
automation.
Contacts who had found recruitment and retention harder
than a year ago had increased pay by more than those who
reported the level of difficulty as unchanged, and had raised
pay growth, compared with 2017, by more on average
(Chart C). This was true of pay for both key skill positions and
more broadly.

Private sector regular pay growth has also strengthened, to a
little under 3% in recent months. Other indicators of private
sector pay pressures have also risen. Private sector settlements
data are consistent with an increase in median pay growth of
around 0.5 percentage points relative to a year ago. The Bank’s
Agents’ measure of average growth in labour costs has picked
up in recent quarters (Chart 3.8). The REC pay survey, which is
a measure of the pay growth of new recruits, also implies a
strengthening in pay growth.
In the public sector, AWE growth has picked up notably over
the past year, although it softened slightly in the three months
to May. Excluding bonuses, public sector pay growth has risen
from around 1½% to 2¼% — having been somewhat more
subdued than private sector pay growth since 2014
(Chart 3.9).
The 1% cap on public sector pay awards has been lifted from
the 2018/19 pay round, which should contribute further to
public sector pay growth. The MPC’s forecasts are conditioned
on Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projections for
public sector pay growth, which allow for the lifting of the 1%
pay cap.(2) Since the OBR forecast was published, a number of
public sector pay agreements for 2018/19 have been
announced, as well as a multi-year agreement for the NHS,
which could boost public sector pay slightly further. Following
the next Budget in the autumn, the MPC’s forecast will
incorporate updated OBR projections that include an estimate
of the effects of these announcements.
Public sector pay rises will have a direct effect on
whole-economy pay growth, as public sector employment
constitutes around one sixth of overall employment. There
may also be indirect effects, in part as some private sector
companies use public sector settlements as a benchmark when

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 3 The labour market and pay 25
negotiating pay agreements, and in part as private sector
companies may have to offer higher salaries in response to
recruit and retain staff. Empirically, while there is some
evidence for a short-term influence of public sector
settlements on those in the private sector, there is little
empirical evidence for a significant long-term influence.(3)
Over the next few years, whole-economy pay growth is
projected to rise to around 3½% as productivity growth rises
slightly and the tightness of the labour market puts upward
pressure on wage growth (Section 5).
For inflationary pressures, growth in unit labour costs is more
relevant than wage growth alone. This depends on how fast
wages and other costs of labour are rising relative to
productivity. As explained above, part of the weakness in wage
growth in recent years has been driven by weak productivity
growth, and as such, unit labour cost (ULC) growth has been
less subdued (Chart 3.10).
Non-wage labour costs, such as pension contributions, also
affect labour cost growth. These costs boosted ULC growth in
2016–17, in part due to the phased introduction of
auto-enrolment of employees into pension schemes and the
abolition of contracting out of the state pension. The
minimum employer contribution to pension schemes under
auto-enrolment rose in April, and is set to rise further over the
next year, contributing a little to overall ULC growth.
Rising wage growth means that ULC growth is projected to
average around 2¼% in coming years, a continuation of the
gradual acceleration since the crisis. ULC growth averaged ½%
during 2010–15 and 1¾% in 2016. Recently, ULC growth has
picked up further, although it has been boosted by temporarily
weak growth in output per head (Chart 3.10). In part that
reflected a temporary dip in output growth in Q1 (Section 2)
that was not mirrored in employment growth. As this effect
diminishes, ULC growth declines a little from current rates, but
remains higher than its average over the past few years,
contributing to domestic cost and inflationary pressures
(Section 4).

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 4 Costs and prices 26
4 Costs and prices
CPI inflation is expected to have risen temporarily in July, in part due to higher energy prices. As
well as energy, the rise in import prices following the referendum-related depreciation of sterling
has held inflation above the 2% target. Most of that rise in import prices has now been passed on to
consumer prices and so inflation is projected to fall back towards the target. Domestic inflationary
pressures are building to more normal levels. Inflation expectations remain broadly consistent with
the target.
4.1 Consumer price developments and the
near-term outlook
CPI inflation was 2.4% in 2018 Q2, as expected in the
May Report. Within that, the June inflation figure was
0.1 percentage points lower than anticipated (Chart 4.1),
as upside news in energy prices was more than offset by
downside news in a small number of non-energy goods
components such as clothing and footwear, recreational goods
and food prices. Much of that downside news appears to have
reflected an unusual degree of discounting during the month,
which is expected to be largely temporary.
Inflation is expected to rise temporarily to 2.6% in July, before
falling back again from August (Chart 4.2). That occurs as the
contribution from external costs — energy prices and the
pass-through of higher import prices following sterling’s
referendum-related depreciation — diminishes (Section 4.2).
That decline is expected to be more gradual than projected in
May, however, given the 2½% fall in sterling since the run-up
to the May Report (Section 1).
In addition to external costs, the path for inflation will depend
on domestic inflationary pressures. Those domestic pressures
have been gradually picking up and are expected to remain
firm (Section 4.3). In particular, labour cost pressures are
strengthening (Section 3). Inflation expectations, which can
influence wage and price-setting, remain consistent with
inflation returning to the target in the medium term
(Section 4.4).
4.2 External cost pressures
Energy prices
Global energy prices affect CPI inflation directly through their
impact on petrol prices and domestic gas and electricity bills.
Coupled with this, there are indirect effects, for example on
production and transport costs, which take longer to feed
through to consumer prices.

Inflation Report sterling oil futures curve, shown in Chart 4.3.
Inflation Report August 2018 Section 4 Costs and prices 27
The sterling spot price of oil has risen by 7% since the
May Report (Chart 4.3), primarily due to a depreciation of
sterling against the US dollar. While there has been some
volatility in recent months, the spot price has remained
around 50% higher than in mid-2017. Changes in oil prices
tend to be passed on to fuel prices, and therefore CPI inflation,
relatively quickly. Accordingly, fuel prices are adding
0.4 percentage points to inflation at present (Chart 4.2).
The oil futures curve — on which the MPC’s forecasts are
conditioned — remains downward sloping, however. As such,
the contribution from fuel prices to inflation falls over the next
year, and turns slightly negative by mid-2019.
The gas futures curve has also risen, by around 15% since May
(Chart 4.3), which will put upward pressure on retail gas and
electricity prices. That follows rises in wholesale prices over
the past year. The pass-through of wholesale gas prices to
retail energy prices tends to take much longer than for
changes in oil prices and the degree of pass-through varies
over time. Rises in electricity and gas prices implemented by
utility companies in recent months reflect earlier increases in
wholesale prices being passed on with a lag.
Acting in the opposite direction, the announced cap on most
standard variable tariffs (SVTs) — due to be implemented by
the end of 2018 — may reduce some utility bills. There is
currently uncertainty around the level of the cap, which will be
determined by Ofgem, and therefore its precise implications
for CPI. SVTs are the only tariffs currently captured in the CPI
basket, so only changes in those tariffs will be directly
reflected in CPI inflation.
Overall, the effects of higher wholesale gas costs on future
household energy prices and of the tariff cap are expected
broadly to offset each other. There is a large degree of
uncertainty around the net impact and the timing, however,
which could lead to some volatility in the contribution of
energy to inflation over the next few years.
Non-energy import costs
In addition to higher energy prices, the period of above-target
inflation since 2016 can be accounted for by rises in the cost of
non-energy imports facing UK companies and households.
Those higher import costs (Chart 4.4) largely reflect the
referendum-related depreciation of sterling. In addition, world
export price inflation — changes in the foreign currency prices
companies in other countries charge for their exports — has
risen during this period, in part due to a pickup in oil and other
commodity prices (Section 1), which are inputs into the
production of many goods and services.
Changes in the sterling value of foreign export prices tend
to feed through to import prices within a year. As such it is
likely that the effect of sterling’s depreciation around the
EU referendum on import prices has already come through.

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 4 Costs and prices 28
Import prices are expected to have been broadly flat in the
year to 2018 Q2 (Chart 4.4). Some pass-through from the
recent depreciation in sterling, and the increase in foreign
currency export prices (Section 1), are expected to push up
import price inflation over the next few quarters (Table 4.A).
The rise in import prices since 2015 Q4 has in turn been passed
on to consumer prices, although that pass-through has some
way to run. That effect has been most apparent in the price of
food and other goods (Chart 4.2), which tend to be more
import-intensive. Non-energy goods inflation has slowed in
recent months, and its contribution to CPI inflation is
projected to fall slightly to 0.7 percentage points by the end of
2018 as the impact of sterling’s depreciation continues to
diminish. That is consistent with responses to a recent survey
by the Bank’s Agents on consumer demand. The effect of
import prices on inflation is set to diminish further over the
next couple of years (Section 5), albeit by slightly less than
anticipated three months ago.
4.3 Domestically generated inflation
Inflation depends both on external cost pressures and on
domestically generated inflation (DGI). DGI is influenced by
the degree of spare capacity in the economy and, while it is
not directly observable, there are a number of indicators that
are closely linked to the concept. These include measures
capturing labour costs — the largest domestic cost facing most
companies — and the prices of services — which are generally
provided domestically.
The degree to which wages and other labour costs affect
inflation will depend on how fast they are rising relative to
productivity — unit labour cost (ULC) growth (Section 3).
Following the crisis, slack in the labour market weighed on
wage growth and ULC growth was subdued (Chart 4.5).
As slack diminished during 2016–17, ULC growth picked up.
And in 2018 Q1 ULC growth picked up further, although it
was boosted by temporarily weak productivity growth. Over
coming years, the projected strengthening in wage growth is
expected to push up domestic cost pressures relative to the
past few years (Section 5).
In contrast to rising labour cost pressures, DGI as measured by
services sector inflation has softened. One particular measure
is inflation in the price of core services, which excludes
components that are more likely to be related to tradable
prices or government policy, such as airfares and education.
That particular measure, which accounts for just over 40% of
the CPI basket, fell to 2.0% in Q2, from an average of around
2½% during 2017 (Chart 4.5). That decline in part reflects
previous erratic strength in a few components, such as coach
fares and car insurance premiums, unwinding. In addition,
services inflation is affected by external costs to some degree,
as many service providers will use imported goods and services

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 4 Costs and prices 29
as inputs. Some of the recent fall in services inflation will
therefore reflect the diminishing effect of the past
depreciation of sterling.
Subdued services inflation also in part reflects low rent
inflation, which fell to 0.4% in June from around 3% in early
2016, and is expected to remain subdued in coming quarters.
Rent inflation is less directly affected by slack in the economy
or external cost pressures, and is more closely related to
developments specific to the housing market, such as the
weakness in the London market (Section 2). Around half of the
decline since early 2016 can be accounted for by lower rents
paid for social housing — property owned by local authorities
or housing associations. That has largely reflected the
Government’s policy to reduce rents for most tenants in that
sector by 1% a year from April 2016 until April 2020.
Nonetheless, rents account for around 20% of the core
services basket, so services inflation is expected to remain
subdued and rise only gradually in coming months (Chart 4.2),
despite the pickup in ULC growth.
4.4 Inflation expectations
Inflation expectations can influence domestic inflation
through wage and price-setting behaviour. For example, if
companies and households become less confident that
inflation will return to the MPC’s 2% target, that may lead to
changes in wage and price-setting that make inflation persist
above the target for longer.
The MPC monitors a range of indicators derived from financial
market prices and surveys of households and companies to
assess whether inflation expectations remain consistent with
the target. Shorter-term indicators of inflation expectations
picked up during 2016–17 as CPI inflation rose, and as inflation
has fallen back some of those indicators have fallen a little
alongside it (Table 4.B). Some longer-term household
indicators have edged up a little since 2016, although they
remain close to past averages and so appear to be consistent
with CPI inflation returning towards the target. Overall, the
MPC judges that inflation expectations remain well anchored.

5 Prospects for inflation
CPI inflation and activity have evolved broadly in line with the MPC’s expectations at the time of
the May Report. Inflation was 2.4% in June, above the target due to sterling’s past depreciation and
higher energy prices. Those external cost pressures are projected to dissipate over the forecast
period, though at a slightly slower rate than projected in May following the further fall in the
sterling exchange rate over the past three months. GDP growth appears to have recovered in Q2.
UK demand is expected to continue to grow at a modest pace which, given subdued potential
supply growth, is likely to be more than sufficient to use up the very limited degree of slack
remaining in the economy. Conditioned on a path for Bank Rate that rises to 1.1% over the next
three years, a small margin of excess demand is likely to emerge by late 2019 and to build
thereafter, raising domestic inflationary pressures. Taken together with diminishing external
pressures, CPI inflation is projected to decline towards the target, reaching 2% in the third year of
the forecast period.
UK GDP growth is reported to have dipped to 0.2% in Q1,
partly reflecting the temporary impact of adverse weather. But
it is estimated to have recovered to 0.4% in Q2, as anticipated
in the May Report.
Global GDP growth was slightly weaker than expected in Q2
and the outlook has moderated slightly over the past three
months. Nevertheless, most indicators of global activity
suggest that growth should remain relatively robust at
above-potential rates (Key Judgement 1).
Along with accommodative financial conditions, relatively
robust global growth is projected to support UK demand,
particularly investment and net trade. Uncertainty around the
United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements continues to
weigh on business investment, however (Section 2). And while
the fall in sterling associated with the EU referendum is
boosting net trade, it is still having some dampening effects on
the growth rates of household real income and consumption
(Key Judgement 2). The sterling ERI was around 2½% lower
than in the run-up to the May Report and around 17% below
its late-2015 peak. As in previous Reports, the MPC’s
projections are conditioned on the average of a range of
possible outcomes for the United Kingdom’s eventual trading
relationship with the European Union. They also assume that
households and companies base their decisions on the
expectation of a smooth adjustment to those new trading
arrangements.
The MPC’s projections, summarised in Table 5.A, are
conditioned on those assumptions and a path for Bank Rate

available to 2021 Q2 in May.
(b) The August projections have been conditioned on the assumptions that the stock of purchased gilts remains
at £435 billion and the stock of purchased corporate bonds remains at £10 billion throughout the forecast
period, and on the Term Funding Scheme (TFS); all three of which are financed by the issuance of central
bank reserves. The May projections were conditioned on the same asset purchase and TFS assumptions.
(c) Four-quarter growth in real GDP. The growth rates reported in the table exclude the backcast for GDP.
Including the backcast 2018 Q3 growth is 1.6%, 2019 Q3 growth is 1.8%, 2020 Q3 growth is 1.7% and
2021 Q3 growth is 1.7%. This compares to 1.7% in 2018 Q3, 1.7% in 2019 Q3 and 1.7% in 2020 Q3 in the
May 2018 Inflation Report.

that reaches 1.1% by mid-2021 (Table 5.B), just over
10 basis points lower than in May.(1) Four-quarter GDP growth
is projected to recover from its temporary weakness at the
start of 2018, and average around 1¾% over the forecast
period (Chart 5.1), similar to May. Potential supply growth is
subdued relative to pre-crisis norms, reflecting continued
weakness in productivity growth and slower growth of the
working-age population. The pace of demand growth is more
than sufficient to absorb the very limited degree of
spare capacity that currently remains in the economy
(Key Judgement 3). A range of indicators suggest that the
labour market is tight. Unemployment remains low, and is
projected to fall a little further (Chart 5.2). The economy
moves into excess demand by late 2019. That leads to a
continuing firming of wage growth and domestic inflationary
pressures.
While domestic inflationary pressures firm over the forecast
period, external cost pressures ease (Key Judgement 4). The
rise in import prices following sterling’s referendum-related
depreciation and higher energy prices have accounted for
above-target inflation since the beginning of 2017, but their
combined impact is likely to subside in coming years. Inflation
is projected to decline towards the target (Chart 5.3),
although the depreciation of sterling since the May Report
slows the projected pace of decline slightly compared with the
previous forecast (Chart 5.4). Inflation reaches 2% in the
third year of the forecast period.
At its meeting ending on 1 August 2018, the MPC voted to
increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.75%, to
maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment grade
corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central
bank reserves, at £10 billion and to maintain the stock of
UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of
central bank reserves, at £435 billion. The factors behind that
decision are set out in the Monetary Policy Summary on
page i of this Report and in more detail in the Minutes of the
meeting.(2) The remainder of this section sets out the MPC’s
projections and the risks around them in more detail.

expectations, other policy measures as announced
The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth. It has been conditioned
on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b). To the left of the vertical dashed line, the distribution
reflects uncertainty around revisions to the data over the past. To aid comparability with the official
data, it does not include the backcast for expected revisions, which is available at Data from the
August 2018 Inflation Report. To the right of the vertical line, the distribution reflects uncertainty
over the evolution of GDP growth in the future. If economic circumstances identical to today’s were
to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that the mature estimate of
GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan chart
is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter green areas on
30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie
somewhere within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions
GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the green area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this
has been depicted by the light grey background. See the box on page 39 of the November 2007

The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment. It has been

interpretation as in Chart 5.1, and portray 90% of the probability distribution. The calibration of this
fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example, it is
judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on
unemployment in successive quarters. The fan begins in 2018 Q2, a quarter earlier than the fan for
CPI inflation. That is because Q2 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in part on
data for April and May. The unemployment rate was 4.2% in the three months to May, and is
projected to be 4.1% in Q2 as a whole. A significant proportion of this distribution lies below
Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment rate. There is therefore
uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart.

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 5 Prospects for inflation 32
5.1 The MPC’s key judgements and risks
Key Judgement 1: global demand grows at above-potential
rates
Global economic growth has remained above trend in the first
half of 2018, with four-quarter growth, using PPP weights, a
little under 4%. World goods trade growth has decelerated in
recent months, however, and the outlook for global activity
and trade appears to have moderated slightly since the
May Report. This reflects a recent pickup in geopolitical
uncertainty, in part related to an intensification of trade
tensions, alongside tightening financial conditions particularly
in some emerging economies. Nonetheless, financial
conditions remain accommodative by historical standards and,
alongside healthy business and consumer confidence, should
support global growth at rates above potential over the
forecast period.
Quarterly euro-area growth dipped in the first half of 2018,
averaging 0.4%. That was slower than the 0.7% average rate
experienced in 2017 and below the May forecast. Some of the
slowing appears to reflect temporary factors, however, and
indicators suggest that underlying demand growth remains
healthy (Section 1). As a result, growth is expected to tick up in
the near term, albeit to slightly lower rates than projected in
May (Table 5.C). Thereafter, it slows towards potential.
Above-trend growth will lead to the gradual absorption of
spare capacity. As that slack is absorbed, core inflation is
projected to rise to just over 1½% by the end of the forecast,
slightly lower than expected at the time of the May Report.
Quarterly US growth was 1% in Q2, up from 0.5% in Q1. Q2
GDP was higher than expected in May and well above trend
rates. Looking ahead, the tariffs that have been implemented
and proposed on bilateral trade between the US and its
trading partners, including China, are likely to weigh on growth
(Section 1). Taken together, the MPC’s central projection for
US activity is little changed from May. As in May, growth is

Chart 5.3 CPI inflation projection based on market interest rate
expectations, other policy measures as announced
Charts 5.3 and 5.4 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future. They have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.A footnote (b). If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail
on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan charts are constructed so that outturns of inflation
are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on
the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey background. See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002
Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

expected to ease over the forecast, partly reflecting a declining
boost from recent fiscal measures. Nevertheless, excess
demand builds, and inflation is expected to remain above 2%
throughout the forecast period.
While GDP growth in China and other emerging economies
has in aggregate remained relatively robust, the outlook has
softened compared with the May Report. In China, the tariffs
on trade with the US, and an associated fall in equity prices,
are expected to dampen growth a little. In other emerging
economies, tightening monetary policy in the US and
increasing trade tensions — as well as idiosyncratic
institutional and political developments in some countries
— have resulted in tighter financial conditions. On average,
emerging economy government and corporate bond spreads
have risen by around 60 basis points and equity prices have
fallen by 8% since the May Report. Moreover, emerging
economy currencies have depreciated by around 6% against
the dollar, on average, and some central banks have increased
policy rates to try to stem capital outflows. That tightening in
financial conditions weighs on the growth projection, which is
a little lower than in the May Report.
Global growth — based on PPP weights — is projected to be
3¾% in 2018, before slowing to 3½% (Chart 5.5). Weighted
by UK export shares, growth is projected to slow from 2¾% in
2018 to 2¼% in 2020 (Table 5.C). Those projections are a
little lower than three months ago, reflecting the impact of
the implemented and proposed tariffs on trade and tighter
financial conditions in emerging economies. The potential for
a continued increase in the barriers to trade and for a further
tightening in financial conditions create downside risks to the
outlook. On the upside, there remains a possibility of a larger
recovery in productivity growth, which would allow economies
to grow more quickly without leading to inflationary pressure.
Key Judgement 2: net trade and business investment
continue to support UK activity, while consumption growth
remains modest
The outlook for UK demand is very similar to that in May.
After some temporary weakness in the near term reflecting
the slowing in quarterly growth in Q1, four-quarter GDP
growth is expected to average around 1¾%. Net trade and
business investment support GDP growth, while consumption
grows modestly, in line with real incomes.
Net trade contributed positively to growth in 2017 and
2018 Q1. Although it is expected to have subtracted from
growth in 2018 Q2 — which will depress its contribution to
GDP growth in 2018 as a whole — that appears to reflect
erratically weak export growth. Survey indicators of export
growth remain robust (Section 2) and net trade is expected to
improve in the second half of the year (Table 5.D). Export
demand will continue to benefit from relatively robust growth

in the global economy. Net trade will also be supported by the
lower sterling exchange rate.
Business investment has also been supported by external
demand, as well as by the low cost of finance, the relatively
high rate of return on capital, and the incentive to invest to
expand capacity. The pace of growth has been dampened,
however, by the anticipation of, and uncertainty over, Brexit.
Business investment is currently estimated to have fallen in
2018 Q1. This may in part reflect the impact of adverse
weather on construction-related investment (Section 2).
Growth is expected to have recovered in Q2, and to remain a
little above its past average rate over the rest of 2018. That
rate is subdued relative to past recoveries, reflecting the drag
from uncertainty. As that wanes, business investment growth
is expected to rise a little further (Table 5.E), although there is
a risk that uncertainty increases and weighs more heavily on
growth.

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 5 Prospects for inflation 35
Consumption growth has been modest since 2017. In large
part, that reflects weak growth in households’ real incomes,
which have been squeezed by the rising cost of imports
following sterling’s referendum-related depreciation.
Consumption growth has declined by less than real income
growth over the recent past, however, as households have
reduced their rate of saving, supported by rising net wealth
(see Box 4), high employment and accommodative financial
conditions (Section 2). Real income growth is expected to be
higher over the forecast period than it has been in recent
years, as nominal wage growth continues to pick up
(Key Judgement 3) and the drag from import price inflation
continues to fade (Key Judgement 4). Consumption is
expected to grow broadly in line with real incomes, such that
the saving ratio remains broadly unchanged.
The housing market has also been subdued. Price inflation has
fallen over the past year and activity has been flat. That is
likely in part to reflect weak real income growth, in common
with consumption. Developments in the housing market can
also affect consumption growth independently through wealth
and collateral channels. Thus far, the weakness in the housing
market appears to be concentrated in London (Section 2). The
MPC judges that has partly reflected idiosyncratic factors, and
so is unlikely to have significant spillovers to wider UK housing
markets. Annual UK house price inflation is projected to
recover to just over 3% over the forecast period.
There is uncertainty about the extent to which households will
adjust their spending and saving. The saving ratio is estimated
to have fallen to a low level over the past few years and
households might choose to build savings at a somewhat
faster rate as real income growth rises, depressing spending.
Unemployment remains low, however, and households
currently report a historically high degree of job security. So it
is possible that households could lower their saving rate
further, boosting consumption growth, with the additional
support of generally healthy balance sheets.
Key Judgement 3: demand growth outstrips subdued
potential supply growth, and a margin of excess demand
emerges, pushing up domestic cost growth
The speed at which demand can grow before it puts upward
pressure on inflation depends on the amount of slack in the
economy and on the growth rate of potential supply. The MPC
judges that there is currently only a very limited degree of
slack remaining in the economy, given the tightness reported
in the labour market (Section 3) and little evidence of much
spare capacity within companies. Given that, demand can only
sustainably grow at rates in line with the expansion of
potential supply.
As set out in its assessment of supply-side conditions in
February, the MPC judges that growth in potential supply
will remain subdued relative to pre-crisis rates, at around 1½%

per year on average. Within that, labour supply growth is likely
to be modest, and a little slower than current rates. That
slowing in part reflects an expected decline in net inward
migration in line with the ONS projections on which the
MPC’s forecasts are conditioned. Offsetting that, structural
productivity growth is projected to improve somewhat to
close to 1%, although that remains around 1 percentage point
lower than pre-crisis norms. The pickup in productivity growth
over the forecast partly reflects higher investment feeding
through to an increase in the capital stock.
There are significant risks to the outlook for productivity. On
the downside, productivity growth has been lower than
expected since the financial crisis. It could fail to pick up again
if, for example, lower-than-expected investment weighs on
the growth of the capital stock. On the upside, productivity
growth could pick up to closer to historical norms. That could
be driven by a boost to productivity growth from higher
investment, if companies substitute towards capital and away
from labour in a tight labour market, for example.
Conditional on market interest rate expectations of Bank Rate
rising to 1.1% over the forecast period, demand is projected to
grow a little faster than potential supply over the forecast
period, such that a small margin of excess demand emerges by
late 2019 and continues to build thereafter.
The absorption of slack and emergence of excess demand will
put upward pressure on domestic cost growth. Domestic
inflationary pressures have been subdued over the past few
years while there has been some degree of slack in the
economy. Labour costs, which are the largest domestic
component of companies’ costs, have generally grown at
modest rates for much of the post-crisis period.
Pay growth has picked up over the past year in both the
private and public sectors. The labour market has tightened
and companies have found it harder to recruit and retain staff
(Section 3). That is apparent in a range of survey indicators of
firms’ hiring difficulties and pay — including the Agents’ recent
survey (see Box 5). Higher wage growth will lead to increased
inflationary pressure to the extent that it occurs without a
commensurate pickup in productivity growth. Over the past
year or so, the increase in annual pay growth has not been
matched by higher growth in productivity per head, such that
unit wage and labour cost growth have risen. Over the forecast
period, private sector and whole-economy unit labour cost
growth are projected to remain higher than they have been
over the past few years, leading to a gradual firming in
domestic inflationary pressures.

Key Judgement 4: domestic inflationary pressures
continue to build over the forecast period, while external
cost pressures ease
CPI inflation has fallen back since the start of 2018. In
2018 Q2 it was 2.4%, in line with the MPC’s expectation at
the time of the May Report. The decline in inflation over
2018 has partly reflected a waning impact from import
prices, which rose substantially following the
referendum-related depreciation of sterling. The
contribution from import prices to CPI inflation is
estimated to remain elevated, however, and can account
for much of the current overshoot of inflation relative to
the target. The MPC judges that it is likely that the effect of
sterling’s depreciation around the EU referendum on
import prices has already come through, although the
further pass-through to consumer prices has some way to
run. Import price inflation is expected to rise again over the
next few quarters, by slightly more than expected in May
(Chart 5.6), reflecting the recent depreciation of sterling
and an acceleration in global export prices (Section 1). It
will take time for those rises to feed through fully into
CPI inflation and import prices will carry on boosting
inflation over the forecast period, although the overall
boost will wane.
CPI inflation has also been affected by movements in
energy prices. The oil price, which affects fuel prices rapidly
and so can have marked temporary effects on inflation, has
been volatile over the past few months. The sterling oil
price rose sharply around the time of the May Report,
pushing up petrol prices. It has fallen back a little more
recently, however, which reduces its contribution to
CPI inflation in the near term. Further ahead, the oil futures
curve on which the MPC’s forecast is conditioned is
downward sloping, such that the contribution from fuel
prices to inflation turns negative.
Retail gas and electricity prices have risen over the past few
months, reflecting previous increases in wholesale energy
and other costs. Recent further increases in wholesale costs
are likely to put upwards pressure on retail prices over the
forecast period. Acting in the opposite direction is the likely
impact of the forthcoming cap on households’ energy
tariffs (Section 4). The MPC judges that the effects of those
factors on CPI are broadly offsetting, although the size and
timing of both are uncertain.
Taken together, the impact of these external factors on
inflation is expected to dissipate over the forecast period.
The projected strengthening in domestic inflationary
pressures as excess demand builds (Key Judgement 3) only
partially offsets that dissipation in external cost pressures,
such that in the central projection CPI inflation declines
towards the 2% target. Inflation is judged likely to be a
little above the target over much of the forecast period,

before returning to 2% in the third year. That is slightly
higher than expected in May, mainly reflecting the impact
of the recent depreciation of sterling.
5.2 The projections for demand,
unemployment and inflation
Based on these judgements, under the market path for
Bank Rate and the assumption of an unchanged stock of
purchased assets, the MPC projects four-quarter GDP
growth to average around 1¾% over the forecast period
(Table 5.F). That projection is similar to the May forecast
(Chart 5.7). Within demand, consumption growth is
projected to remain modest relative to historical rates, with
net trade and investment supporting growth, in turn
supported by relatively robust global growth. The risks
around the projection are balanced, as in May.
The economy’s supply capacity is judged likely to grow at a
subdued pace — of around 1½% per year on average — over
the forecast period. That is slightly lower than demand
growth, with unemployment projected to fall a little further
as a result and the economy moving into excess demand by
late 2019.

CPI inflation has fallen back since the beginning of 2018, but
remains above the MPC’s 2% target. The inflation overshoot
reflects the impact of external cost pressures from import
and energy prices. Inflation is projected to fall further
towards the target as those effects wane, more than
offsetting building domestic inflationary pressures. Under
the market path for Bank Rate, inflation is judged likely to
decline towards the target, reaching 2% in the third year of
the forecast period (Chart 5.8). The projection is higher
than in May (Table 5.G), mainly reflecting the effect of the
recent depreciation of sterling. The risks around the inflation
projection remain balanced (Chart 5.9).
Charts 5.10 and 5.11 show the MPC’s projections under the
alternative constant rate assumption and an unchanged
stock of purchased assets. That assumption is that
Bank Rate remains at 0.75% throughout the three years of
the forecast period, before rising towards the market path
over the subsequent three years. Under that path, GDP
growth is stronger, and a greater degree of excess demand
emerges, with unemployment falling towards 3½%.
Inflation is higher and ends the forecast period above the
target at 2.2%.

Box 6
The equilibrium interest rate
The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation
target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and
employment. The policy rate required to achieve these
objectives will vary over time. Prior to the financial crisis, the
level of Bank Rate set by the Committee averaged 5%.(1)
During the crisis, however, Bank Rate needed to be cut sharply
in order for the MPC to meet its objectives in the face of major
headwinds to demand. While Bank Rate is expected to need to
rise gradually as those headwinds diminish and slack is
absorbed, longer-term structural influences mean that
those rises are expected to be limited and it is unlikely that
Bank Rate will return to pre-crisis levels anytime soon. This
box presents the MPC’s latest assessment of those influences
on Bank Rate and the outlook for coming years.
Understanding the equilibrium interest rate
The ‘equilibrium interest rate’ is the interest rate that, if the
economy starts from a position with no output gap and
inflation at the target, would sustain output at potential and
inflation at the target. Setting Bank Rate equal to the
equilibrium interest rate may not be sufficient to meet the
2% inflation target at all times, however. For example, if
output were below (above) its potential, Bank Rate would
need to be set below (above) the equilibrium rate for a period
of time in order to return output to potential. Furthermore,
some shocks may create a trade-off between the speed at
which inflation is returned to the target and the support
provided to jobs and activity.(2)
The equilibrium interest rate cannot be directly observed, and
so is not used by monetary policy makers as a direct guide to
setting policy. But to the extent that it — and the factors
driving it — can be estimated, it may help to explain the
evolution of interest rates over the past and provide an
indication of the outlook for interest rates over coming years.
One framework for understanding the equilibrium real interest
rate (r*) — the equilibrium interest rate adjusted for inflation
— decomposes it into a longer-run, or ‘trend’, component (R*)
and a shorter-term component (s*):
The trend real rate, R*, is determined by slow-moving
structural factors that affect the balance between the demand
for capital and the stock of wealth available to finance it. For
an open economy like the UK, those factors will reflect global
influences as well as domestic ones. The upward-sloping red
lines in Figure A show that the quantity of wealth individuals
want to hold tends to increase as real interest rates rise, since
a higher real interest rate implies a greater return on saving. In
contrast, the demand for capital (shown in the blue lines)
tends to be downward sloping: as the quantity of capital rises,
its marginal product falls and so each extra unit of wealth will
earn a lower return.

Stylised diagram of shifts in desired wealth and capital schedules
The trend real rate has fallen over the past few decades across
advanced economies. Much of that fall can be explained by
structural factors such as an ageing global population, which
— for a given real interest rate — have raised the quantity of
wealth individuals wish to hold (a rightward shift in the red
line in Figure A). Other structural factors, including a decline
in trend productivity growth, have reduced businesses’
demand for capital (a leftward shift in the blue line).
Combined, these developments have reduced the trend real
interest rate required to bring actual stocks of wealth and
capital into line.
Over the nearer term, the equilibrium real interest rate, r*, can
fluctuate around its trend level as a result of shorter-term
influences on the economy, s*. During the financial crisis, a
number of headwinds to demand — including a rise in
uncertainty and a tightening in the financial conditions facing
households and firms — meant that the equilibrium real rate
fell sharply. These headwinds to demand are taking many
years to dissipate, meaning that the equilibrium real rate
remains well below the trend real rate R*, which is itself well
below its longer-term average.
The outlook for both the trend real rate and these
shorter-term headwinds will have implications for the likely
future path of Bank Rate. To the extent that the structural
shifts in desired wealth and demand for capital persist,
Bank Rate is likely to remain materially below the 5% level set
(1) Indeed, over the entire period since the Bank of England was founded in 1694,
Bank Rate has averaged close to 5%.

contingencies and Brexit’.

on average by the Committee prior to the crisis. Over the
shorter term, however, Bank Rate is likely to need to rise
gradually as the headwinds to demand recede and the current
margin of spare capacity is absorbed (Section 5).
Estimating the trend real interest rate, R*
The trend real interest rate, R*, cannot be directly observed
and is difficult to estimate with precision. There are a number
of ways in which it can be estimated. One approach is to use
market-based measures implied by long-term government
bond yields. As explained in the box on pages 6–7 of the
May 2017 Report, ‘term structure’ models can be used to
decompose these yields into expected future short-term
interest rates and term premia, which are the additional
compensation that investors require for holding
longer-maturity assets. The average of a range of measures of
the short-term interest rate component currently implies a
forecast for R* of around ½% in 10 years’ time (Table 1).
Macroeconomic models can also be used to estimate how R*
has evolved over the past. Table 1 presents estimates from a
range of studies for different regions based on a variety of such
models. These estimates span a wide range of values, in part
reflecting the fact that they are likely to capture some aspects
of s* as well as R*, as well as substantial variation in modelling
techniques. There are few existing estimates of R* for the UK,
although the openness of the UK economy means that the
level of R* in the UK is likely to be highly correlated with the
level in other advanced economies.
Bank staff have developed a new approach to estimating R*
for the UK.(3) An advantage of this approach, compared to
others, is that it takes account of the fact that some
determinants may overlap and so reduces the possibility that
these will be double counted. One drawback, however, is that
a number of simplifying assumptions are needed in order to
capture these determinants within a tractable framework, and
some potential determinants are not easy to model in this
way. Uncertainty around the central estimates due to these
assumptions, as well as the potential impacts of some omitted
determinants, are discussed below.
The estimation approach follows two stages:
•	 First, a statistical filter is used to estimate R* over the past.
Over long enough periods of time, shorter-term
movements in real interest rates should average zero. The
filter removes these fluctuations, leaving an estimate of R*
which will reflect slow-moving structural factors. The filter
cannot be used over more recent periods, however, as it
relies on data over both earlier and subsequent years to
provide an estimate for any given year.
(3) One rationale for producing these estimates was that existing work has tended to
focus either on global or US trend real interest rates. In addition, existing estimates for
the UK — for example Holston, K, Laubach, T and Williams, J (2017), ‘Measuring the
natural rate of interest: international trends and determinants’— have not
investigated the drivers, or potential future path, of the trend real interest rate.

•	 Second, an overlapping generations model is used to
estimate the change in R* since 1990 and to produce a
projection.(4) In this model, R* is the rate at which the
wealth accumulated by households is sufficient to finance
the capital demanded by firms. Given the openness of the
UK economy to global capital flows, global changes in
desired wealth and capital are likely to be important in
determining the trend real rate in the UK. The model used
by Bank staff allows UK R* to depend on both global and
domestic structural developments.
Results based on this approach suggest that R* in the UK has
fallen by more than 2 percentage points since 1990. Allowing
for uncertainty around the precise starting point and filter
length, R* in real terms is estimated to have fallen from
around 2¼%–3¼% (with a modal estimate of around 2½%)
to around 0%–1% currently (with a modal estimate of around
¼%).(5) Adding the 2% inflation target in order to convert
those numbers into nominal terms results in a current
estimate of nominal R* in the range of 2%–3%.(6) As explained
in more detail below, shorter-term forces currently acting on
the UK economy have pushed nominal r* below this level.
There is substantial additional uncertainty around these
estimates, however, depending on the modelling assumptions
and the paths for the main determinants of R* in the model.
One calibration of those uncertainties is shown in Chart A.
The red line shows the estimated probability attached to the
current level of R* having a particular value, while the blue line
shows the historical distribution of real interest rates over the
20th century. The leftward shift from the blue line to the red
line implies that there has been a material fall in the level of
R* over time. But the range of potential values of current R*
covered by the red line shows that plausible changes in
assumptions can translate into substantial differences in its
estimated level.
Many of the factors estimated to have lowered R* over the
past are likely to persist for many years, such that R* is
projected to remain around its current level for some time to
come. There is a wide degree of uncertainty around the
persistence of the fall, however. Factors that are omitted from
the model estimates may also play a role, and are discussed
below.
Influences on R*
Part of the estimated decline in R* can be explained by an
increase in the amount of wealth individuals wish to hold for a
given real rate of interest. In turn, much of that increase has
been due to the effects of changing global demographics
(Table 2). Net wealth typically rises over an individual’s
working life, since people tend to accumulate savings gradually
in order to finance spending in their retirement. Over the past
few decades, global population growth has slowed as birth
rates have declined and life expectancy has increased.
Together, these developments have contributed towards a
rising average age of the population of advanced economies
(Chart B),(7) which has meant that a greater proportion of the
population is at stages of life associated with higher levels of
wealth. The corresponding rise in wealth holdings is estimated
to have reduced R* since 1990.
(4) For more details on such models, see for example Lisack, N, Sajedi, R and Thwaites, G
(2017), ‘Demographic trends and the real interest rate’. Demographic shifts are
important determinants of R*, and one benefit of this modelling approach is that it
allows different generations of individuals to be modelled separately and to interact
with each other.
(5) The 1990 range represents the 5th and 95th percentiles of estimates based on slightly
different starting years and a distribution around the time period to which the
statistical filter is applied. The range around the 2018 estimate represents the impact
of using those different estimates for the starting value in 1990. Given the additional
uncertainty around the estimate for 2018, the equivalent interval shown in Chart A is
wider.
(6) A more accurate calculation of the trend rate in nominal terms would involve adding a
measure of CPI inflation expectations rather than the 2% inflation target. Note that
index-linked gilts are indexed to RPI inflation.

Inflation Report August 2018 Section 5 Prospects for inflation 42
The slowing in global population growth and rise in life
expectancy are projected to continue, which will continue to
weigh on R* relative to the past. The median UN projection
implies that the average age of the population in advanced
economies will rise from 41 years in 2015 to 45 years over the
subsequent two and a half decades (Chart B).
The extent to which the rising average age of the global
population reduces R* will depend on the degree to which
older people adjust their working patterns. As explained in the
box on pages 30–31 of the November 2014 Inflation Report,
the proportion of older people in work has risen steadily in
recent decades across advanced economies. That will have
limited the number of years in retirement that individuals are
likely to face, and consequently the amount of wealth required
in order to finance their retirement spending. Rising old-age
employment is estimated to have pushed up slightly on R*,
relative to the past, partly offsetting the downward pressure
from slower population growth and rising life expectancy
(Table 2). In the event that future policy changes result in
further rises in the average retirement age, that could also
provide support to R* in the future.
Another factor estimated to have pushed up slightly on R* is a
rise in the stock of government debt relative to GDP across
advanced economies in recent decades (Table 2), which, for a
given real interest rate, has reduced the quantity of wealth
available to finance investment in the capital stock. To the
extent that these higher levels of debt persist, that will
continue to support R* in the future.(8)
Part of the estimated decline in R* can also be explained by a
fall in the demand for capital for a given real rate of interest.
One reason for that fall has been a slowing in the growth rate
of productivity (Chart C), and hence the potential returns on
new investment. To the extent that productivity growth picks
up, R* will increase in coming years, all else equal.

Another factor estimated to have reduced the demand for
capital — and hence R* — is a rise in the cost of financial
intermediation (Table 2). Part of that rise has reflected
heightened perceptions of risk following the financial crisis
(see below). The rise has also reflected reforms implemented
since the crisis to increase the resilience of the financial
system and to end the problem of ‘too big to fail’. For
example, as part of a broader set of measures, UK banks are
now required to hold far greater loss-absorbing resources and
their capital requirements have increased tenfold. By raising
the cost of financing, these reforms are likely to require R* to
be lower than in the past for a given level of demand for
capital from businesses.
Desired wealth and the demand for capital may be affected by
other factors that are not included within the central
estimates:
(i) Changes in risk perceptions and risk attitudes may have
reduced R* over the past. That could have stemmed from
an increase in the perceived risk of large falls in output
(tail risk).(9) Greater risk aversion may have contributed to
the build-up of savings by Asian economies following the
crises of the 1990s and early 2000s, as they looked to
(8) Under strong assumptions, the level of government debt has no effect on real
interest rates. This ‘Ricardian equivalence’ result relies on households and firms
recognising that higher government debt will ultimately be paid for by increased
future taxes. In more general settings, such as the model used by Bank staff, some
households and firms may not be liable for higher future taxes (for example, because
they may die), and so government debt holdings represent net wealth to those
households and firms.
(9) For more details, see Kozlowski, J, Veldkamp, L and Venkateswaran, V (2018), ‘The
tail that keeps the riskless rate low’, and Vlieghe, G (2017), ‘Real interest rates and
risk’.

self-insure against the possibility of similar events in
future. More recently, the global financial crisis may have
encouraged banks, companies and households to hold a
larger proportion of their portfolio in safe assets.(10)
(ii) Acting in the opposite direction, the increasing financial
integration of lower-income countries may push up R* in
coming years. One reason for that is that the population
of lower-income countries is younger on average than
that of advanced economies. In addition, increased
financial integration could boost R* by supporting a
pickup in overall global productivity growth. While rising
productivity within lower-income economies in recent
decades has closed some of the productivity gap with
advanced economies, there remains significant scope for
further catch-up.
(iii) An increase in automation could also affect R*. On the
one hand, further automation could raise the productivity
of the capital stock, which could in turn raise businesses’
demand for capital. On the other hand, to the extent that
automation results in a lower share of income accruing to
lower-skilled employees, that could raise income and
wealth inequality. Since wealthier households tend to save
a larger proportion of their incomes on average, that could
weigh on R* relative to the past.
The equilibrium real interest rate over the shorter
term, r*
Over the shorter term, the equilibrium real interest rate, r*,
can fluctuate around its trend level, R*, as a result of
shorter-term influences on the economy. A temporary fall in
desired spending relative to potential output, for example,
would be likely to reduce the level of r* required to maintain
output at its potential and to keep inflation around the
target.
r* is very difficult to estimate with precision. Figure B presents
a stylised illustration of how it has probably been evolving
relative to its trend, R*.
During the financial crisis, spending fell sharply in the UK as
uncertainty rose, growth in other advanced economies slowed,
and increased risk aversion and heightened perceptions of risk
on the part of investors resulted in a tightening in financial
conditions. Both the public and private sectors sought to
reduce their pace of borrowing. These shorter-term factors
pushed r* down sharply and it became negative (Figure B).(11)
In such circumstances, setting the effective real policy rate
below r* helps support the economy and close the output gap.
Following the crisis, the MPC supported demand by cutting
Bank Rate to 0.5% and purchasing assets to provide further
monetary stimulus.

Stylised diagram of the equilibrium real interest rate
Many of the headwinds to spending — including the need for
balance sheet repair following the financial crisis — have
persisted for some time. Nevertheless, it is likely that r* has
risen gradually in recent years, with easier financial conditions,
a reduced fiscal drag, the end of private sector deleveraging in
the UK and, in the last couple of years, stronger global growth.
The outlook for interest rates
The outlook for the equilibrium real interest rate in coming
years depends on the persistence of the fall in the trend real
rate, R*, as well as the extent to which the shorter-term
factors (s*) currently pushing down the equilibrium real rate,
r*, continue to unwind.
While any rise in trend productivity growth over coming years
could raise R* somewhat, many of the structural factors
currently weighing on R* — in particular, changes in
demographics — are likely to persist for many years to come.
That means that over the longer term, R*, and hence r*, are
likely to remain lower than in the past.
In the near term, however, the MPC judges that, while recent
headwinds to demand have meant that r* has remained
below R*, r* is likely to rise gradually towards R* if uncertainty
dissipates and as the fiscal consolidation imparts less of a drag
on growth than on average in recent years.
The expected rise in r* over coming years, combined with
the absorption of spare capacity over the forecast period
(Section 5), means that — even as inflation is projected to fall
back towards 2% — Bank Rate is likely to need to rise
gradually in order to keep inflation at the target. But the
persistence of the fall in the trend real rate means that any
rises in Bank Rate are expected to be limited, and interest rates
are likely to need to remain low by historical standards for
some time to come.
(10) For more details, see Bernanke, B (2005), ‘The global saving glut and the US current
account deficit’ and Caballero, R, Farhi, E and Gourinchas, P-O (2017), ‘The safe
assets shortage conundrum’.
(11) Various studies support the idea that the equilibrium real interest rate became
negative during the financial crisis, both in the UK and other advanced economies.
See for example Del Negro, M, Giannoni, M, Cocci, M, Shahanaghi, S and Smith, M
(2015), ‘Why are interest rates so low?’ .

Box 7
Other forecasters’ expectations
This box reports the results of the Bank’s most recent survey
of external forecasters, carried out in July.(1) On average,
respondents had expected four-quarter GDP growth to pick up
gradually to 1.7% in three years’ time (Table 1). That was
unchanged relative to expectations three months ago. External
forecasters’ central projections for the unemployment rate
had declined (Chart A), although they remained higher, on
average, than the equivalent Inflation Report forecast
(Section 5), and implied a rise in unemployment over the next
three years.
External forecasters, on average, had expected CPI inflation to
be at the 2% target at all horizons. And the average probability
placed on inflation being more than 1 percentage point away
from the target in two years’ time — either below 1% or
at least 3% — had fallen to around historically low levels
(Chart B).
External forecasters’ central expectations for Bank Rate at the
two and three-year horizons had increased, on average,
relative to three months ago. And those average central
projections were higher than the market-implied path for
interest rates (Chart C). As in May, almost all forecasters
expected the current stock of gilt and corporate bond
purchases to remain unchanged over the next two years,
although the former was expected to have fallen a little by the
three-year horizon.
