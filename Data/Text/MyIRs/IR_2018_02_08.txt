Inflation Report
February 2018
In order to maintain price stability, the Government has set the Bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) a target for the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index of 2%.
Subject to that, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy,
including its objectives for growth and employment.
The Inflation Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of
the Monetary Policy Committee. It serves two purposes. First, its preparation provides a
comprehensive and forward-looking framework for discussion among MPC members as an aid
to our decision-making. Second, its publication allows us to share our thinking and explain the
reasons for our decisions to those whom they affect.
Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are
based, the fan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths
for inflation, output and unemployment, as well as the uncertainties surrounding those central
projections.
This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with
section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.

Monetary Policy Summary i
Monetary Policy Summary
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the
2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its
meeting ending on 7 February 2018, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at
0.5%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial
investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank
reserves, at £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of
UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at
£435 billion.
The MPC’s latest projections for output and inflation are set out in detail in the accompanying February Inflation Report.
The global economy is growing at its fastest pace in seven years. The expansion is becoming increasingly broad-based and
investment driven. Notwithstanding recent volatility in financial markets, global financial conditions remain supportive.
UK net trade is benefiting from robust global demand and the past depreciation of sterling. Along with high rates of
profitability, the low cost of capital and limited spare capacity, strong global activity is supporting business investment,
although it remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainties. Household consumption growth is expected to remain
relatively subdued, reflecting weak real income growth. GDP growth is expected to average around 1¾% over the
forecast, a slightly faster pace than was projected in November despite the updated projections being conditioned on the
higher market-implied path for interest rates and stronger exchange rate prevailing in financial markets at the time of the
forecast.
While modest by historical standards, that rate of growth is still expected to exceed the diminished rate of supply
growth. Following its annual assessment of the supply side of the economy, the MPC judges that the UK economy has
only a very limited degree of slack and that its supply capacity will grow only modestly over the forecast, averaging
around 1½% per year. This reflects lower growth in labour supply and rates of productivity growth that are around half of
their pre-crisis average. As growth in demand outpaces that of supply, a small margin of excess demand emerges by early
2020 and builds thereafter.
CPI inflation fell from 3.1% in November to 3.0% in December. Inflation is expected to remain around 3% in the
short term, reflecting recent higher oil prices. More generally, sustained above-target inflation remains almost entirely
due to the effects of higher import prices following sterling’s past depreciation. These external forces slowly dissipate
over the forecast, while domestic inflationary pressures are expected to rise. The firming of shorter-term measures of
wage growth in recent quarters, and a range of survey indicators that suggests pay growth will rise further in response to
the tightening labour market, give increasing confidence that growth in wages and unit labour costs will pick up to
target-consistent rates. On balance, CPI inflation is projected to fall back gradually over the forecast but remain above
the 2% target in the second and third years of the MPC’s central projection.
As in previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the
United Kingdom’s eventual trading relationship with the European Union. The projections also assume that, in the
interim, households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading
relationship. Developments regarding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union — and in particular the
reaction of households, businesses and asset prices to them — remain the most significant influence on, and source of
uncertainty about, the economic outlook. In such exceptional circumstances, the MPC’s remit specifies that the 
ii Inflation Report February 2018
Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target
and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity.
Over the past year, a steady absorption of slack has reduced the degree to which it was appropriate for the MPC to
accommodate an extended period of inflation above the target. Consequently, at its November 2017 meeting, the
Committee tightened modestly the stance of monetary policy in order to return inflation sustainably to the target.
Since November, the prospect of a greater degree of excess demand over the forecast period and the expectation that
inflation would remain above the target have further diminished the trade-off that the MPC is required to balance. It is
therefore appropriate to set monetary policy so that inflation returns sustainably to its target at a more conventional
horizon. The Committee judges that, were the economy to evolve broadly in line with the February Inflation Report
projections, monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the
forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November Report, in order to return inflation sustainably to the
target.
In light of these considerations, all members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the
demands of the MPC’s remit. Any future increases in Bank Rate are expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited
extent. The Committee will monitor closely the incoming evidence on the evolving economic outlook, and stands ready
to respond to developments as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.
Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 1
1 Global economic and financial
market developments
The outlook for global growth has strengthened further. As growth has recovered, spare capacity
has diminished, and market interest rates imply some gradual withdrawal of global monetary policy
stimulus over coming years. Sustaining current rates of global GDP growth has become increasingly
dependent on a recovery in productivity growth.
Global GDP growth picked up during 2016 and has been
strong over the past year (Section 1.1). Weighted by countries’
shares of UK exports, global growth is estimated to have
remained at 0.8% in 2017 Q4. That pace of growth is expected
to persist in the near term, above expectations in November.
Survey indicators of output (Chart 1.1) and new orders remain
robust, particularly in the euro area and United States.
Measures of business and consumer confidence are also
healthy. Despite further falls in unemployment across a
number of countries, inflation remains subdued relative to
historical norms (Section 1.2). There are some signs of a
recovery in wage growth, however, and further rises in
commodity prices are pushing up global inflation.
In light of the recovery in GDP growth, some monetary policy
stimulus has begun to be withdrawn across a number of
advanced economies, although policy remains supportive.
In November, the MPC raised Bank Rate to 0.5%, which has
begun to be passed through to retail lending and deposit rates
(see Box 2). Market-implied interest rate paths imply a further
gradual tightening in policy over the coming years.
The improvements in global growth and confidence since
early 2016 have been an important factor supporting rises
in risky asset prices in many countries over that period
(Section 1.3). Since late January, however, around the time
the MPC’s projections were finalised, equity prices have fallen
sharply and volatility in equity markets has risen.(1)
1.1 Global economic developments
In recent years, four-quarter GDP growth has recovered
towards pre-crisis rates in a number of advanced economies
(Chart 1.2). That pace of growth has been met largely by
increased employment, with productivity growth still subdued.
As a result, much of the slack in labour markets that opened
up following the financial crisis appears to have been
absorbed.

2 Inflation Report February 2018
With less remaining slack in labour markets, sustaining the
recent pace of global GDP growth has therefore become
increasingly dependent on a pickup in productivity growth.
Current rates of productivity growth, and shortfalls against
pre-crisis trends, differ across advanced economies (Chart 1.3).
In particular, euro-area productivity growth had begun to slow
prior to the crisis, whereas US and UK productivity growth
picked up during the early 2000s before slowing more
sharply.(2)
Productivity growth is expected to recover across advanced
economies over coming years, but to remain below pre-crisis
rates. Investment spending was reined in following the global
financial crisis. That continues to weigh on growth in the
capital stock — the resources and equipment available to
produce output. Investment growth has begun to recover in
many countries, however, which will support growth in the
capital stock and productivity.
The euro area
Quarterly euro-area GDP growth was robust in 2017 and
faster than in preceding years, at 0.6%–0.7% (Table 1.A). That
pickup in growth has become increasingly broad-based across
countries, supported by an improvement in financial
conditions, alongside rises in business and consumer
confidence. Business survey indicators, such as the IHS Markit
purchasing managers’ indices, have risen further in recent
months (Chart 1.1). Consistent with that, quarterly GDP
growth is projected to be around ¾% in the near term,
stronger than projected three months ago (Table 1.B).
The recovery in demand has led to a continuing decline in
measures of economic slack. Euro-area unemployment was
8.7% in December, down from 9.7% a year earlier (Chart 1.4),
although the extent of the fall in unemployment has varied
across countries. As the recent pace of growth continues,
unemployment is projected to fall further in the near term.
The United States
At 0.6% in 2017 Q4, US GDP growth was broadly in line with
expectations three months ago (Table 1.A). Inventories
dragged on growth in Q4, which is unlikely to persist. Business
surveys point to quarterly growth of around ¾% in 2018 H1
(Chart 1.1). Personal and corporate tax cuts announced in
December are expected to provide a stimulus to activity over
the next three years. Those cuts are slightly larger, and take
effect earlier, than assumed in November, implying additional
support to activity in the near term (Section 5).
Indicators suggest that there is probably little spare capacity
remaining in the US economy. A variety of measures of labour
market slack — including the unemployment rate (Chart 1.4),

particular, see Tenreyro, S (2018), ‘The fall in productivity growth: causes and

underemployment and the rate at which employees are
voluntarily leaving jobs — are around their pre-crisis levels.
Emerging market economies
In China, GDP growth continues to be broadly stable
(Table 1.A). In 2017 Q4, four-quarter GDP growth was
unchanged at 6.8%. Over the past year, activity has been
supported by both increased export demand and strong
domestic credit expansion. Macroprudential policy measures
have led to some slowing in house price inflation and the
authorities have continued to take measures to reduce
financial sector leverage. There remain challenges for the
authorities in maintaining current rates of GDP growth while
reducing risks to financial stability.(3)
Growth in other emerging market economies (EMEs)
continued to recover in 2017, supported by: higher capital
inflows; the recovery in advanced-economy demand; and, for
commodity exporters, the recovery in commodity prices since
early 2016. Those factors are expected to underpin slightly
stronger growth in EMEs than anticipated in November.
1.2 Commodity markets and developments
in inflation
Core inflation — which excludes food and energy prices —
remains subdued relative to historical norms in the euro area
and United States (Table 1.C). There are some signs of wage
growth picking up in those regions, however. And with
unemployment set to decline further in the euro area, and
seemingly little slack in the United States at present, wage
growth and broader inflationary pressures are projected to
build over 2018.
Despite subdued core inflation, rises in commodity prices are
pushing up headline inflation in the euro area, United States
and more widely. As a result, global inflation is a little higher
than projected three months ago.
US dollar oil prices have risen fairly steadily since mid-2017,
as have industrial metals prices (Chart 1.5). Those rises have
in part reflected improvements in global economic activity
that have increased demand for commodities. Demand for oil
exceeded IEA projections over the second half of 2017,
particularly among advanced economies. The rises also reflect
supply developments. The supply of oil has risen at a relatively
modest pace leading to continued falls in oil stocks. In part,
that reflects increased compliance with the late-2016
agreement between OPEC and some non-OPEC oil producers
to curb production, which has since been extended to the end
of 2018.

4 Inflation Report February 2018
By influencing production and transport costs, global
commodity prices are also important drivers of the prices of
other internationally traded goods. Annual world export price
inflation excluding oil is estimated to have slowed to 1.7% in
2017 Q4 (Table 1.C). The more recent rises in commodity prices
are, however, set to push up world export prices and therefore
UK import price inflation slightly in the near term (Section 4).
1.3 Developments in financial markets
Exchange rates
In the run-up to the February Report, the sterling ERI was
3% higher than at the time of the November Report, although
16% below its November 2015 peak. The recent rise has largely
been relative to the US dollar, which has depreciated against
other major currencies. More broadly, sterling has remained
around 15%–20% below its pre-referendum peak (Chart 1.6),
and has been no more volatile than in previous periods
following significant revaluations.
Interest rates
The improving growth outlook has begun to put upward
pressure on short-term market interest rates across advanced
economies over the past year, as expectations have built that
central banks will withdraw some of the stimulus provided by
monetary policy. Market-implied paths for policy rates have
risen further since November (Chart 1.7).
At its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) raised the target range for the federal funds rate to
between 1¼% and 1½% (Chart 1.7). That was the third
25 basis point increase in the target range during 2017. The
median of FOMC members’ projections implies another
75 basis points of tightening during 2018. In addition, and as
announced in September, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet
has started to shrink as a proportion of maturing assets are not
being replaced.(4)
The European Central Bank (ECB) has made no changes to its
policy rates since November (Chart 1.7). The market-implied
path is also broadly flat over 2018. The ECB has continued
with its asset purchase programme, although, as announced
in October, the pace of purchases has been reduced from
€60 billion to €30 billion per month since the beginning
of 2018.
In the United Kingdom, the MPC raised Bank Rate to 0.5%
in November. In the period when the MPC was finalising its
February projections, the market-implied path for Bank Rate
reached 0.75% in 2018 Q4 and just under 1¼% in three years’
time (Chart 1.7). The MPC voted to make no changes to
monetary policy at its December meeting, as set out in Box 1.

Section 1 Global economic and financial market developments 5
Monetary Policy Summary and in more detail in the Minutes
of the meeting.
Longer-term interest rates have risen in recent months
(Chart 1.8). Those rates had been broadly flat over much
of 2017 — albeit at higher levels than in 2016, on average.
Although rates were broadly flat, model-based estimates
suggest that expected policy rates continued to rise
during 2017, but were offset by falls in term premia. Term
premia have risen more recently, although they remain
relatively compressed. Term premia capture the additional
compensation that investors require for holding long-term
bonds and therefore reflect market participants’ perceptions
of the risks and uncertainties around future interest rates.
Market contacts cite the global inflation environment and
the prospect of increases in government bond issuance, net
of central bank asset purchases, over the coming year as
potential sources of the recent rise.
More broadly, continued historically low long-term interest
rates in large part probably reflect slow-moving structural
factors such as demographics. Those factors are likely to
continue to weigh on global interest rates for some time to
come.(5) Consistent with this, market-implied paths suggest
that policy rates will rise by a limited amount in coming years
(Chart 1.7), particularly in comparison to previous tightening
cycles.

Box 1
Monetary policy since the November Report
The MPC’s central projection in the November Report was for
four-quarter GDP growth to pick up from early 2018 and settle
around 1¾%. Consumption growth was projected to remain
subdued, while strong global growth, together with the lower
level of sterling, was expected to support net trade and
business investment. Inflation was projected to rise a little
further above the 2% target in the near term before falling
back over 2018. Conditional on the path for Bank Rate implied
by market interest rates prevailing at the time, inflation was
projected to end the forecast period slightly above the
2% target. That central projection was also conditioned on
the Term Funding Scheme, and on the stocks of purchased
gilts and corporate bonds remaining at £435 billion and
£10 billion respectively.
At its meeting ending on 13 December 2017, the MPC noted
that the recent news in the macroeconomic data had been
mixed and relatively limited. Global growth had remained
strong, while some indicators of domestic activity in Q4
had softened a little. The measures announced in the
Autumn Budget would lessen the drag on demand from fiscal
consolidation, relative to previous plans. The labour market
remained tight, and the latest surveys suggested this would
continue. The impact of November’s rise in Bank Rate on the
interest rates faced by households and firms had been
consistent with previous experience, but it was too early to
form a comprehensive view of its effect on the economy.
CPI inflation had risen to 3.1% in November, slightly higher
than the MPC had anticipated at the time of the
November Report. The MPC continued to judge that inflation
was likely to be close to its peak, and would decline towards
the 2% target in the medium term.
All Committee members judged it appropriate to leave the
stance of monetary policy unchanged. The MPC was of the
view that, were the economy to follow the path expected in
the November Report, further modest increases in Bank Rate
would be warranted over the next few years, in order to return
inflation sustainably to the target. Any future increases in
Bank Rate were expected to be at a gradual pace and to a
limited extent. 
6 Inflation Report February 2018
Corporate capital markets
Developments in capital markets influence the ease and cost
of raising finance for companies. Equity prices rose sharply in
late 2017 and early 2018, particularly in the United States
(Chart 1.9). The recently announced US tax cuts (Section 1.1)
appeared to boost US equities in particular, while rises in
commodity prices (Section 1.2) supported the equity values
of companies within the energy sector. Since late January,
however, around the time the MPC’s projections were
finalised, equity prices have fallen back and volatility in equity
markets has risen. Market contacts describe those falls as
initially prompted by perceptions of increased inflationary
risks.
Equity prices in most countries remain higher than in
mid-2016, supported by the improvements in global
growth and confidence (Section 1.1). Much of the rise in the
FTSE All-Share index over that period (Chart 1.9), however,
has reflected the decline in the exchange rate and its impact
on the sterling value of profits earned in UK-listed companies’
overseas operations. Consistent with that, the equity prices of
UK-focused companies within the index have been broadly
unchanged (Chart 1.9).
Despite rises in government bond yields, corporate bond yields
have fallen over the past couple of years, reducing the cost of
bond financing. The corporate bond spread is therefore lower
than in early 2016 (Chart 1.10), particularly for ‘high-yield’
debt, which is issued by companies perceived as riskier.
Spreads on riskier high-yield sterling bonds have narrowed by
less than their dollar and euro equivalents since early 2016,
however.
Bank funding costs
Capital markets also matter for broader credit conditions
through their influence on bank funding costs. Although they
have been broadly stable over the past six months, the
spreads that banks pay for funding over and above market
interest rates have narrowed significantly since early 2016
(Chart 1.11). That narrowing appears largely to have reflected
the broader improvement in global financial markets.
To ensure bank lending rates remain closely linked to official
policy rates, the Term Funding Scheme (TFS) was introduced
in August 2016 to provide funding at close to Bank Rate for
lenders that maintained or increased net lending, with a
penalty rate for banks that reduced net lending. While the TFS
drawdown window will close this month, existing TFS drawings
will remain in place for up to four years.
In addition to debt, banks can also raise funds through equity
financing, and financial policy can influence the mix of funding.
At its November meeting, the Financial Policy Committee
(FPC) decided to increase the countercyclical capital buffer

not require banks to strengthen their capital positions. It will
require them to incorporate some of the capital they currently
have in excess of their regulatory requirements into their
regulatory capital buffers.
The narrowing in funding spreads over recent years has
contributed to low levels of retail interest rates (Chart B
in Box 2). The recent rise in Bank Rate and increases in its
market-implied path are expected to feed through gradually
into higher rates for households and companies. Nevertheless,
overall, bank funding costs and retail interest rates remain low
by historical standards.

Box 2
Monitoring the effects of the rise in Bank Rate
on retail interest rates
On 2 November 2017, the MPC announced a 25 basis point
rise in Bank Rate to 0.5%. There are a number of ways that
this tightening in monetary policy will affect the economy.
In particular, a change in Bank Rate will affect financial asset
prices (Section 1), lending and deposit rates, and therefore
households’ and firms’ cash flows and their incentives for
saving and borrowing.
Although it is too early to assess fully the implications of the
rise in Bank Rate, this box describes the changes in retail
interest rates so far, in the context of broader developments in
financial conditions. In particular, bank funding spreads have
narrowed significantly over the past 18 months (Chart 1.11),
putting downward pressure on retail interest rates relative to
Bank Rate. Moreover, strong retail competition appears to be
continuing to lower interest rates and squeeze banks’ profit
margins on some lending products. Nevertheless, retail
interest rates have, in general, risen in recent months and are
expected to rise slightly further over coming months as the
rise in Bank Rate continues to be passed through. The MPC will
continue to monitor these rates closely.
Bank Rate is the benchmark around which short-term interest
rates in wholesale money markets, and in turn retail interest
rates, are determined. The November rise in Bank Rate passed
through fully to sterling overnight wholesale interest rates
(Chart A). Movements in financial asset prices and interest
rates at longer horizons were fairly muted, as market
participants had largely anticipated the rise ahead of its
announcement. In particular, the market-implied interest rate
path had already risen and sterling had appreciated following
the publication of the Minutes of the MPC’s September
meeting. Overall, in the run-up to the November Report, one
and two-year swap rates had risen by 25 basis points and
30 basis points respectively, and they have risen further since
(Section 1.3).
Corporate lending rates have risen in recent months (Table 1).
Around 85% of bank lending to companies is at a floating rate,
typically linked to a short-term market rate. In addition to
being passed through to rates on new corporate lending,
therefore, pass-through of changes in Bank Rate to the stock
of corporate loans tends to be relatively rapid. Accordingly,
average rates on outstanding floating-rate corporate loans
have risen by around 20 basis points since August.
Quoted rates on lending to households have also risen, as the
rise in Bank Rate has begun to be passed through (Table 1).
Around 40% of mortgages by value are floating-rate products.
The rise in Bank Rate was passed through automatically to
‘tracker’ mortgages, and has also been passed through to other
floating-rate products.
The share of fixed-rate mortgages has risen in recent years and
is now around 60% by value.(1) Interest rates on fixed-rate
mortgages are based on longer-term funding costs, which
reflect expectations of how Bank Rate will evolve over time.
As market-implied interest rate expectations rose in the weeks
preceding the rise in Bank Rate, some quoted rates on new

fixed-rate mortgages were already increasing ahead of the
November announcement.
Retail competition appears to have continued to squeeze
banks’ profit margins on some products, pushing down interest
rates and offsetting some of the rise in Bank Rate. Indeed, a
two-year fixed rate for a new mortgage at 90% loan to value
has fallen despite the rise in Bank Rate (Table 1), although
these only account for a small share of total lending. That
competition, together with a narrowing in bank funding
spreads (Chart 1.11), mean that rates on new fixed-rate
mortgage products remain significantly lower than 18 months
ago. Those past falls mean that many mortgagors have moved
onto lower interest rates than they had previously when their
fixed rates expired, leading to a fall in effective rates (Chart B).
Rates on other components of household borrowing — such as
consumer credit and student loans — are less responsive to
changes in Bank Rate and tend to be driven predominantly by
other factors. Accordingly, quoted rates on consumer credit
have generally changed little since August (Table 1).
Sight deposit rates have typically responded gradually to
changes in Bank Rate over the past. Prior to the financial crisis,
sight deposit rates were several percentage points below
Bank Rate and lending rates. There are limits to the extent to
which banks can lower deposit rates, however. So sight deposit
rates did not fall as much as Bank Rate during the crisis and in
recent years they have been slightly above Bank Rate. As
Bank Rate rises, the corresponding rise in deposit rates is
therefore likely to be somewhat less. Quoted rates on new
household sight deposits have risen slightly in recent months
(Table 1). Similarly, the effective rate on sight deposits, which
account for around two thirds of the total stock of deposits,
has risen by around 10 basis points (Chart B).
Quoted rates for some new time deposits have fallen in recent
months (Table 1), although the effective rate on the stock of
time deposits has risen a little. Lower quoted rates probably
reflect developments in the cost and availability of other
sources of bank funding. Indeed, the rates on fixed-rate retail
bonds and the rates banks pay to raise funds in financial
markets have fallen since early 2016 (Section 1.3).
Households’ and companies’ spending decisions will be
affected by their expectations of future interest rates, as well
as current rates. According to a recent IHS Markit survey,
three quarters of households expect Bank Rate to rise further
over the next 12 months (Chart C). The Bank’s Agents also
report that businesses expect modest rises in Bank Rate, and
85% of respondents to the latest Deloitte CFO Survey
anticipated a rise during 2018.

10 Inflation Report February 2018
2 Demand and output
GDP growth slowed around the beginning of 2017 but has picked up slightly in recent quarters.
Consumption growth has been subdued as households are adjusting to the squeeze in real incomes
following sterling’s depreciation. That depreciation and the strength in global growth have
supported net trade and should continue to do so. Global growth has also supported business
investment but the drag from uncertainty around the United Kingdom’s future trading
arrangements has meant investment has been notably weaker than in previous expansions.
GDP growth picked up in 2017 H2, having slowed at the start
of 2017 (Chart 2.1). Consumption growth has been subdued as
households have been adjusting to the reduction in their real
incomes due to the fall in sterling (Section 2.2). Partially
offsetting that, net trade has picked up since the start of 2017,
supported by the increase in global demand and sterling’s
depreciation (Section 2.5). Business investment growth has
been stable over the past year, but it is notably weaker than in
previous expansions as a result of the drag from uncertainty
around Brexit.
The near-term outlook is slightly stronger than in November,
with UK growth expected to be supported by the continued
strength in global economic activity (Section 1). But household
real income growth remains subdued. Although growth in GDP
is projected to be modest by historical standards, it is still
expected to be at, or slightly above, that of potential supply
— the pace at which output can grow consistent with balanced
inflationary pressures (Section 3).
2.1 Output
Output growth picked up to 0.5% in 2017 Q4 (Chart 2.1).
That was 0.1 percentage points higher than projected in
November. Much of the increase since 2017 H1 has been
driven by a strengthening in business-facing service sectors.
In addition, manufacturing output growth picked up over 2017
(Chart 2.2), with capital and intermediate goods accounting
for much of that strength. Activity in both business-facing
services and manufacturing sectors is likely to have benefited
from the past fall in sterling and the boost to export demand
from the continued strength of global growth (Section 1).
Offsetting that to some extent, output growth in the
consumer services sector was relatively weak in Q4, reflecting
similar trends in household spending. In addition, disruption to
oil production from the temporary closure of a major
North Sea oil pipeline in December weighed on growth in Q4.

Section 2 Demand and output 11
The pipeline has been reopened and that should boost growth
in 2018 Q1, as production returns to its previous level.
Weakness in construction activity has also weighed on growth
in recent quarters, though some of that may be revised up over
time. Initial estimates of construction output have been
particularly prone to upward revisions in recent years.
Output growth is projected to slow slightly to 0.4% in Q1
(Chart 2.1). That is broadly consistent with survey indicators.
2.2 Household spending
Consumption growth slowed at the start of 2017, with average
quarterly growth over the year expected to have been around
0.3%, down from 0.7% in 2016 (Table 2.A). Within that, there
has been some quarter-to-quarter volatility, partly reflecting
moves in specific components of consumption, such as vehicles
and energy (Chart 2.3).
Although consumption growth has slowed, it has outpaced
growth in real income. Real post-tax income growth has
slowed since the end of 2015, and income fell 0.8% in the year
to 2017 Q3 (Chart 2.4). Households’ real income has been
squeezed by rises in import prices following the depreciation of
sterling (Section 1). In recent quarters, nominal income growth
has also been depressed by a fall in non-labour income, such as
investment income earned on households’ pension schemes.
As discussed in the box on pages 16–17 of the May 2017 Report,
non-labour income is generally less accessible and less visible
to households, and so is likely to be a less significant influence
on short-term spending decisions. The decline in non-labour
income has therefore been reflected in a fall in the saving ratio,
which is now well below its historical average (Chart 2.5). A
measure of saving out of available income, which excludes
some elements of non-labour income, has also fallen, but
remains around its past average.
Real income and the saving ratio are expected to be
temporarily boosted in 2018 Q1 by a fall in taxes paid on
corporate dividends. As explained in the August 2017 Report,
a pre-announced rise in the effective rate of tax on dividends in
2016 led to some dividend payments being brought forward to
the 2015/16 financial year. The tax on this income is generally
paid at the end of the following financial year and so taxes paid
increased in 2017 Q1. As a result, dividend payments in
2016/17 were lower than usual and so taxes paid are expected
to fall in 2018 Q1. That will boost household incomes and the
saving ratio in Q1, but this will unwind in Q2.
One important influence on how much of their incomes
households choose to spend is their confidence about future
incomes and economic prospects. Consumer confidence has
fallen since the start of 2016. It remains, however, only a little

below its historical average (Chart 2.6). Moreover, most of that
deterioration has been driven by lower household confidence in
the general economic situation. Measures reflecting
households’ own finances or spending have been more stable.
Interest rates also influence how much of their incomes
households spend. A rise in interest rates will raise income for
net savers and interest payments by net borrowers. As
borrowers’ spending tends to be more sensitive to such
changes, a rise in interest rates will weigh on consumption
growth through this ‘cash-flow’ channel. In addition, rises in
interest rates will increase the incentive to save rather than
borrow for all households.
As explained in Box 2, the recent rise in Bank Rate is feeding
through to higher borrowing and deposit rates for many
households. Interest rates overall, however, remain at very low
levels, and below those in May 2016.
Over and above changes in Bank Rate, changes in the cost and
availability of consumer credit can also affect spending. There is
evidence of a modest tightening in consumer credit conditions
over the past year. For example, respondents to the Bank’s
Credit Conditions Survey reported a reduction in consumer
credit availability throughout 2017. Consistent with that,
non-price terms, such as the average interest-free period on
credit card balance transfers, tightened slightly over the year.
However, credit conditions are still supportive and competition
between lenders remains intense.
Although availability has fallen slightly, demand for consumer
credit is likely to have remained relatively strong over 2017,
with four-quarter consumer credit growth a little under 10% in
Q4. Credit growth has, however, slowed in the car finance
market, reflecting, at least in part, a slowdown in the rate of
structural change toward dealership finance.(1) There have also
been some recent signs of an easing in wider credit demand.
For example, respondents to the latest Credit Conditions Survey
reported, on balance, a fall in demand for non-credit card
unsecured lending, such as personal loans. Overall, indicators
suggest that consumer credit growth is likely to slow slightly
in 2018. As explained in the box on pages 16–17 of the
November 2017 Report, however, this, in itself, is unlikely to
have a significant impact on consumption.
Consumption growth is expected to remain subdued in the
near term, although stable household confidence and
supportive financial conditions mean that it is projected to
continue to outstrip underlying income growth. Further ahead,
consumption growth is projected to remain broadly stable at
subdued rates (Section 5).

2.3 Housing
Activity in the housing market is a good indicator of
consumption, as decisions about whether to buy a house and
how much to consume tend to be driven by common factors
such as income growth and confidence. It also affects
consumption directly. For example, increases in house prices
can affect spending by raising the value of homeowners’
equity, which can be used as collateral against which to
borrow. This effect is estimated to be small, however.(2)
Developments in the housing market will also affect aggregate
demand through housing investment. That picked up in Q3
(Table 2.A), with quarterly growth above its past average rate.
Around four fifths of housing investment consists of new
buildings and improvements to existing buildings. Housing
investment over 2017 has been supported in part by new
home building, with housing starts having increased since
2016 Q1 (Chart 2.7). Contacts of the Bank’s Agents have
reported that starts have been supported in part by demand
for new-build properties from first-time buyers using the
Help to Buy equity loan scheme. Starts fell back in 2017 Q3,
however, which will weigh slightly on housing investment
growth in the near term.
The remaining fifth of housing investment is made up of
services associated with property transactions. While housing
market transactions have been broadly stable in 2017 H2,
mortgage approvals for house purchase drifted lower
(Chart 2.8). Housing market activity will have been supported
by the low level of mortgage interest rates. Although the
increase in Bank Rate in November has begun to be passed
through to mortgage rates, those interest rates remain low, in
part as a result of continued strong competition among
lenders (see Box 2).
Annualised house price inflation was 5% in Q4, according to
the average of lenders’ indices, above expectations at the time
of the November 2017 Report. More recent data, however,
suggest that house price inflation was weaker in January than
on average in Q4. While price expectations 12 months ahead
remain positive, the RICS survey pointed to some weakness in
the near term, with respondents, on balance, expecting house
price falls over the next three months, driven in particular by
London and the South East.
Overall, activity in the housing market is projected to pick up a
little in the near term, while house price inflation and housing
investment growth are expected to slow slightly. Measures
detailed in the November 2017 Budget to support
homeownership — such as stamp duty relief for first-time
buyers, an expansion of the Help to Buy equity loan scheme
and measures aiming to boost housebuilding — may support
activity, particularly for first-time buyers. The impact on the
overall housing market is likely to be small, however.

Table 2.B Monitoring the MPC’s key judgements
14 Inflation Report February 2018
2.4 Government
The MPC’s projections are conditioned on the Government’s
tax and spending plans detailed in the November 2017 Budget.
Measures set out under these plans suggest a shallower path
for fiscal consolidation over the next three years than in the
March 2017 Budget, on which the MPC’s November forecasts
were conditioned (Chart 2.9). That more gradual
consolidation reflects a combination of increased spending
and a reduction in taxes.
The shallower path of structural budget consolidation is
projected to provide a small boost to GDP over the next
three years, relative to projections in the November 2017
Report, as households and companies adjust their spending
over time in response to Government measures (Section 5).
2.5 Net trade and the current account
The strength in global growth, alongside the depreciation of
sterling, will support demand partly by boosting net trade.
Greater export demand, combined with the rise in profit
margins on exports in sterling terms should encourage new
and existing exporters to expand their production. In addition,
higher import prices should encourage UK households and
companies to substitute towards domestically produced goods
and services. Net trade will also depend, however, on how
companies here and abroad begin to adjust trading
relationships in light of the United Kingdom’s prospective
withdrawal from the European Union.
Exports
Export growth increased to 8.4% in the year to 2017 Q3
(Chart 2.10), slightly stronger than expected in the
November 2017 Report. Much of that growth reflected higher
goods exports over the past year, although services exports
also picked up slightly in Q3.
The depreciation of sterling, alongside the strength of global
demand, is likely to be supporting growth in export volumes.
Between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q3 export prices fell 7% in foreign
currency terms, suggesting some increase in competitiveness.
In addition, export prices rose by 12% in sterling terms, which
suggests that the depreciation has also allowed exporters to
increase their profit margins. The rise in margins should
support an expansion in export volumes for those firms with
spare capacity. Indicators from the CBI, BCC and the Bank’s
Agents all suggest that spare capacity in the manufacturing
sector overall has been reduced over the past year. As spare
capacity dwindles, further expansion by exporters will require
investment in additional capacity (Section 2.6).
Quarterly export growth is expected to have remained robust
in Q4 — consistent with the strength of business services and
manufacturing sector output in that quarter (Section 2.1)
— although four-quarter growth in exports is expected to slow

Section 2 Demand and output 15
somewhat, due to the comparison with unusually strong
export growth at the end of 2016 (Chart 2.10). Survey
indicators suggest that export growth is likely to remain strong
in the near term, as support from the strength of global
demand and the past fall in sterling continues (Section 1).
Imports and net trade
Although the fall in sterling has pushed up import prices,
import growth remained solid over 2017. As a result, import
penetration — the proportion of demand satisfied using
imported goods and services — has continued to rise
(Chart 2.11). Import growth is projected to slow in coming
quarters, as companies gradually adjust their supply chains
and domestic producers of substitutes for imports expand
capacity in response to higher import prices. Consistent with
that, contacts of the Bank’s Agents in the manufacturing
sector reported some increased sourcing from domestic
customers.
With imports and exports growing at a similar pace, net trade
volumes were flat in Q3. The projected strength of exports in
Q4, relative to imports means that net trade probably
contributed significantly to GDP growth in Q4. The strength in
global demand means net trade is expected to continue
contributing significantly to growth further ahead (Section 5).
Although net trade was unchanged in Q3, the current account
deficit — which reflects the balance of nominal trade flows
and other payments between the United Kingdom and rest
of the world — narrowed to 4.5% of GDP. Most of that
reflected a narrowing in the deficit on primary income — the
net value of investment income received by UK residents. The
current account deficit is expected to have remained broadly
stable as a percentage of GDP in Q4 (Chart 2.12).
2.6 Business investment
Business investment growth has been steady in the year to
2017 Q3 (Chart 2.13). It is likely to have been supported by a
number of factors over the past year. Those include supportive
financial conditions, high rates of return on capital and the
strengthening in global demand growth. However, as
discussed in Box 3, other factors, such as uncertainty about
future UK trading arrangements, appear to be weighing on
investment. As a result, investment growth remains notably
weaker than in previous expansions.
Although the increase in Bank Rate has pushed up interest
rates facing companies (see Box 2), the overall cost of
borrowing remains low. UK companies have benefited from
favourable financing conditions in global capital markets,
which have been supported by the global growth outlook
(Section 1). The volume of external finance raised fell slightly
in Q4, largely driven by net corporate bond and equity
issuance (Chart 2.14). Banks responding to the

16 Inflation Report February 2018
Credit Conditions Survey also reported a fall in demand for
lending across corporates of all sizes over 2017 H2.
The strength in global demand growth should encourage
exporters, and domestic producers supplying exporters, to
invest in additional capacity (Section 2.5). The fall in sterling
may also encourage domestically focused companies to
increase investment, in order to expand production of
domestic substitutes for imported goods and services,
following rises in import prices.
Despite those incentives to invest, most surveys of
investment intentions changed little in 2017 (Chart 2.13),
and the Bank’s Decision Maker Panel Survey suggests that
exporters’ investment spending grew no faster than that of
non-exporters in 2017. As set out in Box 3, there is evidence
that the anticipation of Brexit and related uncertainties are
weighing on businesses’ investment plans. Moreover, as the
share of imported inputs in investment is around 30%, the
depreciation of sterling will have increased the cost of
investment.
Overall, business investment is projected to grow at a little
above past average rates in the near term, supported by global
activity and financial conditions. Investment is likely to remain
sensitive to developments in negotiations around the
United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements with the
European Union. Moreover, given past falls, investment
remains low relative to the size of the capital stock. As such,
the capital stock is projected to expand only slowly, weighing
on productivity growth relative to the past (Section 3).

Box 3
Brexit and business investment
The prospect of the United Kingdom’s departure from the
European Union (EU) appears to have been a key influence on
companies’ investment decisions over the past year or so. As
set out in this box, Brexit-related effects appear to have
weighed on investment plans. As a result, growth in business
investment — which, on a four-quarter basis, has picked up
since 2016 H1 to 1.7% in 2017 Q3 — is likely to have been
weaker than it would otherwise have been, given strong global
demand and supportive financial conditions.
Brexit could affect investment decisions in a number of ways.
First, the anticipation of changes to UK trading arrangements
could change the incentives for businesses to invest. It may
discourage some export-focused businesses — particularly
those exporting to the EU — from investing in additional
capacity, while for others the anticipation of domestic
substitution away from imports or improved trading
relationships with non-EU countries could encourage higher
investment. Second, uncertainty around what shape trading
arrangements eventually take could cause companies to defer
or cancel investment plans in the short term. Third, as
discussed in Section 2.6, the Brexit-related fall in sterling could
also affect investment: on the one hand, pushing down
investment by increasing its cost; and on the other hand,
pushing up investment by increasing profit margins on exports,
and therefore the incentive to expand capacity.
Overall, a range of indicators suggests that Brexit-related
uncertainty and expectations around lower future sales are, on
balance, weighing on business investment growth. Estimates
derived from the Bank’s Decision Maker Panel (DMP) Survey
suggest nominal investment was around 3%–4% lower over
the year to 2017 H1 than it would otherwise have been. In view
of the impact of the fall in sterling on the cost of investment
goods, the impact on real business investment is likely to have
been larger. Given the continuing negotiations over the
United Kingdom’s future trading relationship with the EU, there
are risks in both directions to the path for business investment
in coming years. If uncertainty persists, the drag on capital
expenditure could intensify as businesses delay plans further.
By contrast, those deferred plans may be brought forward if
businesses gain clarity about future trading arrangements,
pushing up aggregate investment growth.
Survey evidence on the impact of Brexit on business
investment
Since the referendum, a range of business surveys has, on
balance, pointed to a negative effect on investment from
uncertainty around the United Kingdom’s future trading
arrangements (Chart A). Most surveys, however, only provide
evidence on what share of businesses are planning to adjust
investment, and not by how much.
Data from the DMP Survey can provide quantitative
evidence on how much business investment has been
affected by anticipation of Brexit and associated uncertainty.
The DMP Survey is a monthly survey of senior executives,
set up to monitor the impact of Brexit on companies’
decision-making. As of November 2017, the survey panel
consisted of around 2,400 companies, with around
1,200 responding to the survey that month. Unlike most
other business surveys, the DMP Survey asks participants
for the probabilities they ascribe to various outcomes in
a number of areas relating to their business, from which
average expected outcomes can be calculated.(1)
The DMP Survey results suggest that Brexit weighed on
business investment growth in the year to 2017 H1. Businesses
that rank Brexit among their top three sources of uncertainty
have, on average, reduced investment spending, as have
businesses that, on balance, expect a negative impact from
Brexit on their sales (Chart B). Comparing those responses with
the responses of firms that do not see Brexit as an important
source of uncertainty and/or do not expect a negative impact

Decision Maker Panel’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2017 Q2.

18 Inflation Report February 2018
on sales, Bank staff estimate that, in the year to 2017 H1,
Brexit-related uncertainty and expectations of lower future
sales reduced nominal investment by around 3%–4%.(2)
The depreciation of sterling associated with Brexit may have
also affected investment, over and above those direct effects.
For example, the increased costs of investment means that
the drag on real business investment is likely to have been
somewhat larger.
Export-focused companies are likely to be particularly
affected by Brexit-related uncertainty. Perhaps consistent
with that, the Bank’s Agents’ company visit scores suggest
that investment intentions by exporters were broadly flat
over 2017, despite an increase in export sales (Chart C). And in
the Bank’s DMP Survey, investment growth for exporters has,
on average, been no stronger than that for other companies.
That is despite support from global demand growth and a rise
in profit margins due to the fall in sterling.
Responses to the DMP Survey suggest that these
Brexit-related effects on business investment growth are
expected to diminish over the next year. Applying the same
approach as above to companies’ expected investment spend
over the following year suggests that investment is expected
to be reduced by a further 1½%–2% in the year to 2018 H1.
DMP Survey results are, however, from responses up to
October 2017 and some businesses may have reassessed their
investment plans more recently in light of developments in
Brexit negotiations. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that,
overall, clarity has not increased enough to motivate a
substantial reassessment of their investment plans but those
plans remain sensitive to further developments.

Section 3 Supply and the limits to growth 19
BANK CONFIDENTIAL LAST UPDATED 7 FEBRUARY 2018 18:45 V9a
3 Supply and the limits to growth
Unemployment remains at historically low levels and the MPC judges that very little slack remains
in the economy. Notwithstanding a projected rise in structural productivity growth, potential
supply growth is expected to be subdued. As a result, the pace at which output can grow without
generating inflationary pressures is likely to remain modest.
In the medium term, the pace at which output can grow
without generating inflationary pressures — known as the
potential growth rate of the economy — is determined by the
economy’s supply capacity. In turn, that depends on structural
features of the economy such as population growth and
growth in productivity. In the short term, however, there may
be scope for output to grow more quickly than this if resources
are underutilised such that there is ‘slack’ in the economy.
Thus, in judging how fast the economy can grow without
generating inflationary pressures, the MPC assesses both the
degree of slack and the outlook for potential supply.
During the financial crisis, output fell, unemployment rose
substantially and a significant degree of slack opened up. In
the years since then, output growth has risen (Chart 3.1). But
much of that recovery in output growth has been accounted
for by a rise in total hours worked as slack in the labour market
has been absorbed. The unemployment rate, for example, fell
from 8.5% in 2011 to 4.3% in the three months to November
(Chart 3.2), its lowest level since 1975. At the same time, the
potential growth rate of the economy has remained subdued
due to persistent weakness in productivity growth.
In the run-up to this Report, the MPC conducted its annual
reassessment of supply-side conditions. Based on the range of
evidence set out in this section, the MPC judges that very little
slack remains overall (Section 3.1). Furthermore, the rate of
potential growth is projected to be subdued at around 1½%
(Section 3.2). As such, the pace of demand growth consistent
with balanced domestic inflationary pressures is likely to be
modest (Section 5).
3.1 Slack in the economy
The degree of slack in the economy — or the gap between
demand and potential supply — is a key determinant of
domestic inflationary pressures. Judging the degree of slack is
difficult, however, since the level of potential supply cannot be
directly observed.

20 Inflation Report February 2018
BANK CONFIDENTIAL LAST UPDATED 7 FEBRUARY 2018 18:45 V9a
The MPC’s best collective judgement is that the overall margin
of slack is currently very small, at just under ¼% of GDP. That
is broadly consistent with the results from top-down statistical
filters that estimate potential supply using past observations
of GDP, inflation and unemployment, as well as with detailed
evidence on the degree of slack within individual components
of supply. Those individual components encompass spare
resources within the labour market — reflected in
unemployment and inactivity — and within firms. While the
overall margin of slack is judged to be only slightly narrower
than in November, its composition is now judged to be
different, with greater slack remaining within average hours
worked but less within companies’ capital utilisation.
Slack within the labour market
The degree of slack in the labour market reflects the balance
between companies’ labour demand and the amount of labour
supplied by households. Growth in labour demand is likely to
have remained robust in recent quarters, with most indicators
of employment intentions above their historical averages and
the number of vacancies relative to the size of the labour force
continuing to increase (Table 3.A). As a result, employment
growth has generally been solid. Although employment fell in
Q3, these data tend to be volatile and employment growth
rebounded in the three months to November.
Robust growth in employment over 2017 has resulted in a
further tightening of the labour market. Survey measures of
recruitment difficulties are above their past averages and most
picked up further in Q4 (Table 3.B). The unemployment rate
fell from 4.7% at the start of the year to 4.3% in the three
months to November and is expected to remain at that level
in coming months (Chart 3.2).
As discussed in Box 4, declines in unemployment beyond a
certain point, known as the equilibrium rate, will put upward
pressure on wages and inflation as jobs become increasingly
difficult to fill at prevailing wage rates. The equilibrium rate is
unobservable and hard to estimate with precision. Based on a
range of evidence, the MPC judges that the long-term
equilibrium unemployment rate is around 4¼%, a little lower
than judged a year ago and broadly in line with the current
headline rate of unemployment.
When judging the overall degree of slack in the labour market,
it is important to consider broader measures than just the
unemployment rate. Increases in the number of people in
work, for example, can be associated not just with a fall in
unemployment, but also with people entering employment
who previously said they were not actively looking for work.
The ‘marginal attachment’ ratio — the proportion of the
population who report that they would like a job but are not
currently seeking work — has fallen sharply in recent years
(Chart 3.3). That suggests that the scope for the employment

BANK CONFIDENTIAL LAST UPDATED 7 FEBRUARY 2018 18:45 V9a
rate to increase further as such people enter the labour market
is likely to be limited.
Slack within companies
There may be scope for companies to expand output by
utilising their existing capital or labour more intensively.
According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), for example,
average hours worked in Q3 were a little below the hours that
households said they would like to work. And, while the share
of part-time workers who report that they would prefer a
full-time job has fallen, it remains above its pre-crisis average
(Chart 3.4). As such, there is likely to be some scope for
companies to increase output by raising the number of hours
their employees work. There is likely to be little scope for
companies to use their existing capital more intensively,
however. Survey indicators of companies’ capacity pressures,
for example, are currently around normal (Chart 3.5).
3.2 The outlook for potential supply
Since very little slack is judged to remain in the economy, the
speed at which output can expand without generating
inflationary pressures will largely depend on growth in
potential supply. That growth can be driven either by increases
in labour supply — the size of the labour force and the number
of hours that people are willing to work — or by growth in
productivity — the amount produced for each of those hours
worked.
Labour supply
In recent decades, growth in the size of the UK workforce has
tended to come mainly from population growth. Growth in
the working-age population — those aged over 16 — has
slowed in recent quarters, in part due to a slowing in net
migration, which fell to 230,000 in the year to 2017 Q2 from
336,000 in the previous year.
In the MPC’s latest forecasts, population growth is assumed to
evolve in line with the ONS’s principal projection published in
October 2017. In that projection, growth in the working-age
population remains slower than on average over the past
decade (Chart 3.6). Within that, the ONS projects a further
slight fall in annual net migration, to 211,000 by mid-2020.
Box 5 describes the implications of lower net migration for
overall UK labour supply.
The extent to which changes in the population affect the size
of the workforce, however, depends on the proportion of the
population who are active in the labour market versus, for
instance, those in retirement or education. As explained in
Box 5, that proportion — the participation rate — is expected
to remain broadly flat in coming years (Chart 3.6).

BANK CONFIDENTIAL LAST UPDATED 7 FEBRUARY 2018 18:45 V9a
Box 4
The equilibrium rate of unemployment
The unemployment rate has fallen sharply in recent years,
from 8.5% in late 2011 to 4.3% in the three months to
November, its lowest level since 1975. When unemployment is
low, that tends to put upward pressure on wage growth and
inflation as companies need to pay more in order to recruit
suitably skilled staff. And when unemployment is high, wage
and inflationary pressures tend to be subdued as companies
find it relatively easy to recruit and retain the right people. A
key judgement for the MPC is where the ‘equilibrium rate’ of
unemployment is — the rate consistent with meeting the
inflation target in the medium term. This box explores the
concept of the equilibrium unemployment rate in more detail
and the evidence for where it currently lies.
What determines the equilibrium rate of
unemployment?
The equilibrium unemployment rate can vary over time. Over
the longer term, it represents the rate of unemployment that
the economy is capable of achieving sustainably over many
years. This long-term rate is determined by the structural
features of the economy that affect the time it takes for
people to find the right jobs, for example the extent to which
potential workers are a good match for the jobs companies
want to fill. It will also be influenced by the tax and benefit
regime, which affects the incentives for people to move
between employment and unemployment. Since these factors
tend to be slow-moving, the long-term equilibrium rate is
usually assumed to change only slowly over time.
In the shorter term, cyclical factors, such as changes in the mix
of unemployment, can also affect the unemployment rate
consistent with stable wage pressures. For example, people
who have been out of work for over a year tend to be less
likely to find employment than those who have been out of
work for a shorter period of time, and so tend to exert less
downward pressure on wages and inflation.
Following the financial crisis, that shorter-term equilibrium
unemployment rate probably rose as the proportion of people
out of work for over a year increased sharply (Chart A). But
that effect has largely unwound, with the proportion
unemployed for over 12 months back at its pre-crisis average.
That suggests that the recession was not associated with any
structural rise in long-term unemployment, in contrast to
previous UK experience. It also suggests that the shorter-term
equilibrium unemployment rate is likely to be close to its
long-term structural rate.
Equilibrium unemployment and wage growth
The equilibrium unemployment rate is unobservable and so
difficult to estimate with precision. One way of assessing its
level, however, is to make use of the relationship between
unemployment and wages. After accounting for factors other
than unemployment that are likely to be influencing wage
growth — for example growth in productivity — it is possible
to infer what the rate of equilibrium unemployment would
need to be in order to be consistent with current wage growth.
In February 2017, the MPC lowered its estimate of the
long-term equilibrium rate from 5% to 4½%, following a
period when wage growth had been below its projections over
successive quarters. A lower equilibrium rate helped explain
those forecast errors. Over the past year, annual pay growth
has remained subdued (Section 4). Although that partly
reflects continued weakness in productivity growth, including
that stemming from recent shifts in the composition of
employment growth, it would, all else equal, be consistent
with a long-run equilibrium unemployment rate somewhat
below 4½%.
A more formal way of using the relationship between
unemployment and wages to estimate the equilibrium rate is
to use statistical filtering techniques.(1) These techniques
impose an assumption about the relationship between
unemployment and wage growth, for example that it is linear.
The estimated equilibrium rate is then allowed to vary over
time in order to capture persistent structural changes in the
labour market. Chart B shows that the equilibrium
unemployment rate estimated using one such statistical filter
has fallen since 2010. Although there is considerable

Section 3 Supply and the limits to growth 23
BANK CONFIDENTIAL LAST UPDATED 7 FEBRUARY 2018 18:45 V9a
uncertainty around these statistical estimates, over the past
year they suggest that the equilibrium rate has fallen very
slightly further and remained close to the headline
unemployment rate.
The structural determinants of equilibrium
unemployment
Another way to estimate the level of equilibrium
unemployment is to examine the structural features of the
economy that determine the time it takes people to find the
right jobs. When the efficiency with which employees are
matched to new job vacancies improves, or when the rate at
which existing jobs are destroyed falls, then, for a given level
of labour demand, the long-run equilibrium unemployment
rate will fall.
One factor likely to have improved the efficiency with which
employees are matched to job vacancies is a rise in the
average educational attainment of the workforce. More highly
skilled workers are likely to be better-suited on average to the
jobs on offer. In addition, technological progress — for
example the increasing use of online vacancy sites — is likely
to have improved job matching by reducing the cost to
companies of advertising vacancies and to workers of
searching for new jobs. Despite these developments, however,
the rate at which the unemployed move into employment —
which depends in part on the efficiency of job matching —
remains no higher than prior to the crisis (Chart C).
The rate at which jobs are destroyed is also likely to have been
affected by structural changes. Increased flexibility within the
labour market may have meant that employment contracts
can be adjusted more easily, such that firms are able to reduce
employee hours to lower levels for a period without making
their workers redundant. This will tend to lower the
equilibrium unemployment rate, although it may also lead to
periods of ‘underemployment’ of those in work if hours are
reduced below the level of those that employees wish to work.
Last year, the MPC judged that such structural changes had
reduced the job destruction rate and hence the rate of
equilibrium unemployment. Since then, the job destruction
rate has fallen slightly further (Chart C), largely due to a fall in
the number of people moving from temporary work into
unemployment. Should these developments persist, they
would suggest that the equilibrium unemployment rate is
lower than previously thought.
Conclusion
Taking all the evidence together, the MPC judges that the
long-term equilibrium rate of unemployment is slightly lower
than judged a year ago, at around 4¼%. That is broadly in line
with the headline rate of unemployment. Taken together with
other evidence (Section 3.1), overall slack within the economy
is likely to be very small at just under ¼% of GDP.

Finally, overall labour supply will depend on the average
number of hours those employed are willing to work. This is
projected to fall very slightly in coming years (Chart 3.6), in
part reflecting the increasing proportion of the population in
older age groups, who tend to work fewer hours (see the box
on pages 22–23 of the February 2016 Report).
Taking all these factors together, potential labour supply is
projected to grow by 0.4% per year on average over the next
three years, much lower than its average of 1.2% in the years
following the crisis (Chart 3.6).
Productivity
Given the relatively subdued outlook for labour supply growth
and very little slack within the economy (Section 3.1), growth
in the economy’s overall supply capacity will rely in large part
on trends in structural productivity growth.
Four-quarter hourly productivity growth stalled in the first half
of 2017 and, while it picked up slightly in the second half of
the year, it nevertheless remains subdued. One reason for the
recent weakness may have been a shift in the composition
of employment growth relative to past norms. Employment
growth in the year to Q3 was concentrated in people and
jobs with characteristics typically associated with
lower-than-average wages (Section 4). To the extent that
these characteristics are associated with lower levels of
productivity, this shift in employment composition is likely
also to have reduced aggregate productivity growth. These
compositional effects will reduce productivity growth only for
as long as such shifts continue, however.
More generally, productivity growth has been so weak since
the financial crisis that the level of productivity is barely above
its pre-crisis peak (Chart 3.7). A standard growth-accounting
framework suggests that around half of the weakness since
2010 has been associated with slow growth in the amount of
capital — the resources and equipment available to produce
output — per hour worked (Chart 3.8). In turn, that reflects
subdued business investment over much of that period
(Section 2). The remainder of the weakness in productivity
growth is accounted for by weak growth in the efficiency with
which labour and capital are put to use, known as total factor
productivity.
Sectoral data may provide further information about the
drivers of the shortfall in productivity growth. These data
suggest that over half of the shortfall relative to pre-crisis
rates has been concentrated in the financial and insurance
services and manufacturing sectors (Chart 3.9). To some
degree, the slowdown in financial services is likely to reflect
unusually high growth in measured productivity prior to the
crisis, driven by increased leverage and risk-taking within
financial firms over that period. In addition, mismeasurement
of financial services output may have played a role in

Box 5
The implications of changing demographics
for UK labour supply
At a basic level, output in the economy can expand because
either there are more people producing it or gains in
productivity enable more output to be produced by the same
workforce. Increases in the size of the workforce have
accounted for nearly all of UK output growth over the past
decade. Those increases have in turn resulted mainly from
population growth, although changes in labour market
participation rates have also been significant (Table 1).
In the MPC’s projections, the size and composition of the
population are assumed to evolve in line with the ONS’s latest
principal population projections, published in October 2017.
Under those projections, growth in the workforce is subdued
relative to the past decade, as the average age of the
population continues to rise and the level of net migration
falls. This box discusses the implications of these
developments.
Implications of an ageing population
The proportion of the UK population aged over 65 has been
rising steadily, from 20% of the 16+ population in 1997 to
22% in 2016, and it is projected to rise to 23% by 2020,
accounting for most of the growth in the 16+ population in the
ONS projections (Chart A). A rising average age, all else equal,
tends to reduce labour supply growth, since it reduces the
proportion of people participating in the labour market
relative to those in retirement. Currently just over 10% of
those aged over 65 are in work or seeking work, compared
with 79% of those aged 16 to 64.
Despite this effect from population ageing, UK labour market
participation has been stable in recent years. This is in part
because the average participation rates of older people have
increased. As explained in the box on pages 30–31 of the
November 2014 Report, a number of factors are likely to have
contributed to that increase, including better health and
improved longevity, and rises in the state pension age. The
stability in aggregate participation also reflects other
developments, including the continued rise in the proportion
of women in or seeking work. The MPC judges that the
participation rate is likely to remain broadly flat over the
forecast period, as the factors supporting participation
continue to offset the effect of demographic shifts.
Implications of falling net migration
Another feature of UK demographics over the past decade has
been the significant contribution of net migration to growth
in the UK workforce (Table 1). Since the EU referendum,
however, levels of long-term migration have fallen and
the ONS projects a further gradual fall in coming years
(Chart B).(1) All else equal, that will reduce the pace of growth
in UK labour supply slightly.
There is a chance that net migration could fall more sharply
than the gradual decline implied by the ONS projections.
There tends to be a positive relationship between migration
flows to the United Kingdom and economic conditions in the
United Kingdom relative to those in migrants’ home countries.
Bank staff analysis suggests that the subdued outlook for
UK GDP per capita, combined with stronger growth prospects
in other countries (Section 1), would, on its own, reduce net
(1) The official long-term migration statistics shown in Chart B define a long-term
migrant as ‘a person who moves to a country other than that of his or her usual
residence for a period of at least a year, so that the country of destination effectively
becomes his or her new country of usual residence’.

migration by a little more than implied by the ONS
projections over the next three years. In addition, net
migration is likely to be affected by any changes to
institutional arrangements for the movement of labour, or
uncertainty around those arrangements.
It is possible that lower net migration from the European
Union could have effects on potential supply over and above
those that arise simply from their effect on population growth.
Data from the LFS, for example, suggest that migrants from
the European Economic Area tend to be more likely to
participate in the labour market than those from the domestic
population, in part because these migrants also tend to be
younger. They are also more likely to hold degrees than people
in the domestic population. To the extent that these degrees
are associated with higher levels of skills and productivity, a
fall in net inward migration could affect overall UK
productivity growth. Given the number of migrants relative to
the size of the existing UK population, however, combined
with the fact that — despite their higher qualifications —
migrants tend not to be disproportionately represented in
higher-skilled occupations, these effects are likely to be small.
Impact on aggregate demand and inflation
What matters for inflation is not only the impact of changes in
the population on potential supply, but also the effect on
aggregate demand. As explained in the box on pages 30–31 of
the May 2015 Report, the impact of a change in labour supply
on GDP growth and inflation will depend in part on the reason
for that change. In general, a rise in labour supply caused by
higher net inward migration tends to have only a small impact
on aggregate wage growth and inflation, since it results in a
contemporaneous increase in aggregate demand as migrants
begin to spend straight away.(2)
Particularly abrupt falls in migration as a consequence of the
Brexit vote could, however, result in labour shortages in
sectors that have become reliant on migrant labour, and hence
greater pricing pressures within those sectors. Shortfalls of
seasonal foreign workers — who may not be captured within
the official long-term migration statistics — have been widely
reported by contacts of the Bank’s Agents within sectors such
as logistics and food processing.

overemphasising the effects on productivity growth of higher
financial sector leverage prior to the crisis and the
deleveraging since then.(1) Although financial services
productivity growth may pick up relative to the period
following the financial crisis, the pace of growth seen in the
2000s is unlikely to return.
In the manufacturing sector, it is possible that the process of
offshoring could have boosted measured productivity growth
during the early 2000s.(2) In addition, productivity growth is
likely to have been affected by trends in world trade flows.
Growth in world trade tends to be associated with productivity
(1) Part of the output produced by financial institutions is known as FISIM (financial
intermediation services indirectly measured). It is possible that the growth rate of
FISIM — which relates closely to the stock of loans and deposits — can overstate
changes in the services provided by these institutions to households and companies.

implications’. See also Burgess, S (2011), ‘Measuring financial sector output and its

Section 3 Supply and the limits to growth 27
BANK CONFIDENTIAL LAST UPDATED 7 FEBRUARY 2018 18:45 V9a
gains through greater economies of scale and increased
competition,(3) and so — since manufacturing firms tend to be
highly integrated within global supply chains — their
productivity growth is likely to have been affected by the
weakness in trade growth since the crisis.
The shortfall in productivity growth can also be analysed at
the firm level. Productivity growth varies widely between
companies, and has tended to come from those companies at
the frontier of the productivity distribution.(4) Although that is
still the case, the slowing in productivity growth since the
crisis also reflects slower growth of the top end of that
distribution, while the lower end of the distribution has, on
average, experienced stronger growth than in the past
(Chart 3.10).
As well as these pre-existing trends, the outlook for
productivity growth is likely to be affected by changes in
trading arrangements as a result of Brexit. Any reduction or
reorientation of trade and supply chains, for example, is likely
to weigh on productivity growth for a period.(5) In addition,
uncertainty around the eventual shape of the post-Brexit
trading arrangements has been weighing on business
investment (see Box 3), and consequently growth in the
capital stock.
Overall, the MPC judges that productivity growth is likely to
pick up in coming quarters, as the weakness in productivity in
early 2017 unwinds and business investment increases
(Section 2). Growth in structural productivity is expected to
remain subdued, however, as the factors weighing on growth
since the crisis persist, and the impact of Brexit continues.
Furthermore, since there is judged to be little scope for
companies to use their existing capital more intensively
(Section 3.1), growth in output per hour is projected to be
broadly in line with this structural rate, and hence a little
slower than projected in November (see Box 6).
(3) See the box on page 29 of the August 2016 Inflation Report for more details. Many
studies find that competition leads more productive firms to expand and less
productive firms to exit markets, raising aggregate productivity, for instance

Economic Studies, No. 83(1), pages 87–117.

28 Inflation Report February 2018
4 Costs and prices
CPI inflation has remained around 3%. The overshoot of the 2% target is almost entirely due to the
effects of higher import prices, following the depreciation of sterling. As these effects begin to
diminish, inflation is expected to fall, but the recent rise in oil prices means that fall is more gradual
in the near term than projected in November. Alongside that, wage growth appears to be picking
up, suggesting building domestic cost pressures.
4.1 Consumer price developments and the
near-term outlook
CPI inflation rose to 3.1% in November, triggering an
open letter from the Governor to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, before falling back to 3.0% in December
(Chart 4.1). That was higher than the 2.7% projected in
the November Report, reflecting the impact of higher
global oil prices on retail fuel prices (Section 4.2) and
larger-than-expected contributions from recreational goods
and airfares, although these components tend to be volatile.
Continued above-target inflation over the past year has
predominantly reflected the rise in import prices following the
depreciation of sterling since November 2015 (Section 1).
Higher import prices are being passed on to retail prices,
pushing up inflation for those components that tend to have
the greatest imported content, for example food, energy and
other goods (Chart 4.2). Those contributions are probably
close to their peak, and inflation is expected to fall back
towards the 2% target gradually as the effects of the
depreciation begin to diminish.
The further rise in global oil prices since the November Report
adds to external cost pressures, however, at least over the
next year or so. As such, the fall in CPI inflation is projected to
be more gradual in the near term than expected at the time of
the November Report. And it is possible that CPI inflation
could rise back above 3% temporarily.
The path for inflation further ahead will depend on the balance
between the speed at which the effects of higher import and
energy prices diminish (Section 4.2) and the pace at which
domestic inflationary pressures rise. Measures of those
domestic pressures have been subdued but there are signs of a
modest strengthening (Section 4.3). In particular, unit labour
cost growth is projected to be supported by a rise in pay
growth in response to the tightening in labour market
conditions (Section 3).

Section 4 Costs and prices 29
4.2 External cost pressures
Energy
In the run-up to the February Report, the sterling spot Brent oil
price was 15% higher than at the time of the November Report
and was at its highest level since late 2014 (Chart 4.3). That
reflected a sharp rise in US dollar oil prices following the
strengthening in global economic activity and only moderate
growth in oil supply (Section 1).
Changes in oil prices tend to be passed on to fuel prices
relatively quickly. The further rise in oil prices since November
is expected to push up CPI inflation in 2018 Q1 by an
additional 0.2 percentage points, although that is partly offset
by the impact of the freeze in fuel duty announced in the
November 2017 Budget.
Although the spot price of oil is higher, the oil futures curve,
on which the MPC’s forecasts are conditioned, has risen by less
and continues to slope downwards. That downward slope pulls
down projected inflation during 2019 by just under
0.1 percentage points on average, a slightly bigger drag than
implied at the time of the November Report.
Rises in retail gas and electricity prices in the first half of 2017
have been pushing up inflation, but those rises will drop out of
the annual comparison in coming months. Partly offsetting
that, some small increases in utility bills are expected towards
the end of 2018, as more recent rises in sterling spot wholesale
gas prices, and the sterling gas futures curve on which the
MPC’s projections are conditioned, feed through.
Non-energy imported costs
As set out in previous Reports, recent above-target inflation
has reflected higher non-energy import prices facing UK
companies. That largely reflects the depreciation of sterling,
which is 16% below its November 2015 peak. In addition,
world non-oil export prices — the foreign currency prices
companies in other countries charge for their exports —
weighted according to countries’ shares in UK imports, have
risen in recent years (Section 1) and are projected to increase
slightly further during 2018.
Between 2015 Q4 and 2017 Q3, non-energy import prices rose
by 10% (Chart 4.4), just under half of the rise in sterling world
export prices. As explained in the box on pages 28–29 of the
November 2015 Report, Bank staff have estimated that, on
average, 60% of changes in the sterling value of non-energy
world export prices are subsequently reflected in UK import
prices. As most of that occurs within a year the current degree
of pass-through is a little less than expected and, in addition,
some indicators of import price inflation have fallen
(Chart 4.4). Depending on how companies react to the change
in the exchange rate, it can take longer for the full effect to

come through. As such, import prices are expected to rise a
little further in 2018. There is a risk, however, that the shortfall
in import prices relative to the size of the fall in sterling is not
fully made up.
The rise in non-energy import prices since the end of 2015 has
accounted for most of the rise in companies’ costs over that
period. That appears to have squeezed consumer sector
companies’ profit margins (Chart 4.5), although these are
being restored as companies pass cost increases on to higher
retail prices. As explained in the box in the November 2015
Report, the CPI is estimated to rise by around 30% of any rise
in import prices. This pass-through has been gradual, on
average, in the past with the peak impact on inflation after a
year and inflation continuing to be pushed up for a further
three years after that.
In the November 2016 Report, the MPC judged that the
pass-through from higher non-energy import prices to
consumer prices was likely to occur more rapidly than in the
past, due to the nature of the depreciation. It is difficult to
measure the precise degree of pass-through but, if anything, it
appears to be a little greater than expected so far. Inflation
among more import-intensive components of the CPI — those
components that are imported or have an above-average
share of imported inputs, and are therefore most affected by
import price increases — has risen sharply (Chart 4.6).
Overall, the impact of the depreciation of sterling on
CPI inflation is broadly as expected and is probably close to
its peak. That contribution is likely to fall back over the
forecast period but the precise path will depend on the speed
and extent of further rises in import prices (Section 5).
4.3 Domestic cost pressures
Once the transitory effects from the fall in sterling have
passed through, and in the absence of further external cost
shocks, CPI inflation will be mainly determined by domestic
inflationary pressures.
The cost of labour, and in particular wages, is the largest
domestic cost facing most companies and hence is a
significant driver of domestic inflationary pressures. The
degree to which those costs affect inflation will depend on
growth in unit labour costs (ULCs) — the labour costs
associated with producing a unit of output.
Wages and unit labour costs
ULC growth has slowed since the end of 2016 (Chart 4.7).
That mainly reflects a decline in the contribution from
non-wage labour costs, which had previously been pushing up
ULC growth as a result of higher pension contributions.
Forthcoming increases in minimum contributions for
auto-enrolled pensions will continue to push up non-wage

unemployment rose. But even though unemployment has
fallen back in recent years, to its lowest level since 1975, pay
growth has remained subdued relative to historical norms.
For the most part, the weakness of pay growth reflects slow
productivity growth (Section 3), so has not affected ULC
growth (Chart 4.7). One factor that is likely to have been
weighing on both productivity and wage growth in recent
years is changes in the composition of the workforce. During a
downturn in the economy, job losses tend to be concentrated
in lower-skilled, lower-paid roles. Fewer lower-paid workers
mechanically lifts average pay even if the wages of those
remaining in work are unchanged. As the economy recovers
and unemployment falls, this effect tends to unwind,
depressing measures of average wages as those out of work
find jobs. This effect is estimated from LFS data to have
reduced annual pay growth by around ½ percentage point in
2017 Q3 (Chart 4.8). But, to the extent that has also been
associated with lower productivity (Section 3), ULC growth
will have been less affected.
Weak pay growth over the past is also likely to have reflected
slack in the labour market, which will have weighed on
ULC growth. The extent to which lower unemployment puts
upward pressure on wages and inflation depends on where it is
relative to the equilibrium rate, which in turn depends on the
structural features of the labour market. As discussed in Box 4,
the limited response of wage growth to falling unemployment
is one of the reasons why the MPC judges that the long-term
equilibrium unemployment rate is probably around 4¼%,
lower than assumed in previous Reports and broadly in line
with the current headline rate of unemployment, at 4.3% in
the three months to November. The drag from unemployment
on wage growth is therefore likely to dissipate in coming
quarters.
Consistent with pay pressures starting to build as slack has
been absorbed, data from the Annual Survey of Hours and
Earnings suggest that pay growth for those switching jobs,
rather than remaining in the same job, has returned to around
its pre-crisis rate (Chart 4.9). Reports from the Bank’s Agents
suggest that firms have targeted pay rises to those employees
likely to switch jobs in recent years. The REC indicator also
shows some rises in pay growth for new recruits (Table 4.A).
There are also signs that pay growth is starting to rise more
broadly. Three-month regular pay growth relative to the
previous three months has remained around 3% on an
annualised basis (Chart 4.10), somewhat higher than expected

in November. In addition, annual wage growth will be boosted
over coming months as the weakness of pay in late 2016 and
early 2017 drops out of the annual comparison.
Results from the Bank’s Agents’ annual pay survey are
consistent with an increase in pay growth. The survey recorded
an average pay settlement in the private sector of 2.6% in
2017, higher than companies had expected in the survey a year
ago. In 2018, the average private sector pay settlement was
expected to be ½ percentage point higher, at 3.1%. With the
exception of construction, average pay settlements were
predicted to rise in all sectors in 2018. Respondents to the
survey had reported that the main factors pushing up total
labour cost growth per employee were the ability to recruit
and retain staff, employer pension contributions, higher
consumer price inflation and the National Living Wage.
Overall, regular pay growth is projected to rise in coming
quarters, at a slightly faster pace than expected at the time of
the November Report (Table 4.B). In addition, slightly
stronger-than-expected bonus payments are boosting total
annual pay growth, which is expected to reach around 3% in
2018 Q1. ULC growth is expected to have risen in 2017 Q4
(Chart 4.7), by more than anticipated in November, and to
remain firmer as pay growth continues to outstrip productivity
growth (Section 5).
Other indicators of domestically generated inflation
ULC growth is one indicator of domestically generated
inflation (DGI), but there are a number of other measures that
are closely linked to that concept. As discussed in the box on
page 28 of the May 2017 Report, these measures, while useful,
can also be misleading at times, especially following large
changes in sterling’s exchange rate.
While most measures of DGI point to a slowing in recent
quarters, that mainly reflects the effects of sterling. Measures
of service sector inflation and those based on the GDP deflator
rose following the depreciation of sterling from November
2015 and have fallen back in recent months (Chart 4.11).
Abstracting from these effects, DGI is probably just a little
below past averages.
4.4 Inflation expectations
Inflation expectations can influence wage and price-setting
behaviour. For example, if companies and households become
less confident that inflation will return to the MPC’s 2%
target, that may lead to changes in wage and price-setting
that make inflation persist above the target for longer. The
MPC monitors a range of indicators derived from financial
market prices and surveys of households and companies to
assess whether inflation expectations remain consistent with
the target.

Indicators of households’ short-term and long-term inflation
expectations have risen in recent quarters (Table 4.C). Those
measures can be sensitive to the current level of inflation and
are likely in part to reflect the recent pickup in CPI. Most
household measures remain broadly around past average
rates, however. And professional forecasters’ expectations and
those derived from financial markets have been broadly stable.
Overall, the MPC judges that inflation expectations remain
well anchored, and that indicators of medium-term inflation
expectations continue to be consistent with a return of
inflation to the 2% target.

34 Inflation Report February 2018
5 Prospects for inflation
Inflation was 3.1% in November, triggering an exchange of letters between the Governor and the
Chancellor. The current overshoot of inflation above the 2% target is almost entirely due to the
effects of higher import prices following sterling’s depreciation, the contribution from which will
dissipate in coming years. UK GDP growth is projected to remain around its current pace, a slightly
stronger near‑term outlook than in November, supported by strengthening global growth. While
modest by historical standards, that pace of UK growth is more than sufficient to use up the limited
slack remaining in the economy. Under a conditioning path that embodies just under three further
25 basis point rises in Bank Rate over the next three years, a small margin of excess demand
emerges by early 2020 and builds thereafter. Inflation remains above the target as domestic
inflationary pressures continue to firm.
The MPC voted in November to raise Bank Rate to 0.5%. That
is feeding through into higher interest rates for companies
and households in line with past experience (see Box 2). The
MPC’s projections are conditioned on a market‑implied path
for Bank Rate that is around 15 basis points higher than
in November. That path implies a gradual further rise in
Bank Rate to just under 1.2% at the start of 2021
(Table 5.A).(1)
The broad‑based pickup in global growth has strengthened
further, with global growth at its fastest pace in seven years
and above‑trend growth in 90% of the world economy.
Healthy business and consumer confidence, and supportive
financial conditions, mean the current pace of global growth is
likely to persist at least throughout 2018 (Key Judgement 1).
That is stronger than projected in November and the risks
around the outlook for global growth are to the upside.
UK GDP growth was stronger than expected in Q4, although
still modest by historical standards (Section 2). The strength
in global growth is supporting net trade and business
investment. The anticipation of and uncertainty around Brexit,
however, appear to be weighing on investment, and the
associated fall in sterling’s exchange rate is squeezing
households’ real incomes and dampening consumption growth
(1) Unless otherwise stated, the projections shown in this section are conditioned on:
Bank Rate following the path implied by market yields on average in the 15 working
days to 31 January; the stock of purchased gilts remaining at £435 billion and the
stock of purchased corporate bonds remaining at £10 billion throughout the forecast
period and the Term Funding Scheme (TFS), all three of which are financed by the
issuance of central bank reserves; the Recommendations of the Financial Policy
Committee and the current regulatory plans of the Prudential Regulation Authority;
the Government’s tax and spending plans as set out in the 2017 November Budget;
commodity prices following market paths; and the sterling exchange rate remaining
broadly flat. For more details see the ‘Data from the February 2018 Inflation Report’

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 35
(Key Judgement 2). In the run‑up to this Report, the
sterling ERI was 3% higher than at the time of the
November Report, though 16% below the peak in late 2015. As
in previous Reports, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on
the average of a range of possible outcomes for the UK’s
eventual trading relationship with the EU. The projections also
assume that, in the interim, households and companies base
their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to
that new trading arrangement.
Under those assumptions, four‑quarter GDP growth is
projected to average around 1¾% (Table 5.B), supported by
the strength in global growth, a lessening drag from the fiscal
consolidation, accommodative financial conditions and a
modest recovery in household real income growth. The risks to
the central outlook are skewed to the upside (Chart 5.1),
stemming from the possibility of a greater boost from global
demand.
Following its annual reassessment of supply‑side conditions,
the MPC judges that spare capacity has been further absorbed
and that very little remains, despite a small downward
adjustment in the Committee’s judgement of the equilibrium
unemployment rate. Furthermore, and notwithstanding a
projected rise in structural productivity growth, overall
potential supply growth is likely to remain modest by
historical standards (Key Judgement 3). As a result, the pace of
demand growth consistent with balanced domestic
inflationary pressures is judged to be around 1½%, much
slower than pre‑crisis norms.
In the MPC’s projections, the stronger pace of demand growth
is sufficient to absorb the limited degree of spare capacity
sooner than in the November projections, with the economy
moving into excess demand by early 2020. That leads to a
steady firming of domestic inflationary pressures
(Key Judgement 4), albeit from rates below those consistent
with the 2% target. There are signs of tightening in the labour
market as unemployment has fallen, surveys suggest
increasing recruitment difficulties and pay growth is beginning
to rise in response (Section 4). In the central projection,
unemployment falls a little further (Chart 5.2) and rising
growth in pay outstrips that of productivity. That supports
somewhat firmer growth of unit labour costs and rising
domestic cost pressures more broadly.
Inflation is currently a percentage point above the MPC’s
2% target, almost entirely due to the effects of higher import
prices following sterling’s depreciation. Those effects will
diminish gradually in coming years. More recently, the rise in
global oil prices has added somewhat to external cost
pressures. Under the market path for interest rates prevailing
at the time the forecast was finalised,(1) domestic inflationary
pressures firm while the contribution from energy and import
prices dissipates. The balance of these effects means that

Chart 5.1 GDP projection based on market interest rate

The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b). To the left of the vertical dashed line,
the distribution reflects the likelihood of revisions to the data over the past; to the right, it
reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future. If economic circumstances
identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that
the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of
those occasions. The fan chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within
each pair of the lighter green areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast
period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90 out of
100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere
outside the green area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the
light grey background. See the box on page 39 of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller
description of the fan chart and what it represents.

The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for LFS unemployment. It has been
conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b). The coloured bands have the same
interpretation as in Chart 5.1, and portray 90% of the probability distribution. The calibration of
this fan chart takes account of the likely path dependency of the economy, where, for example,
it is judged that shocks to unemployment in one quarter will continue to have some effect on
unemployment in successive quarters. The fan begins in 2017 Q4, a quarter earlier than the fan
for CPI inflation. That is because Q4 is a staff projection for the unemployment rate, based in
part on data for October and November. The unemployment rate was 4.3% in the three months
to November, and is projected to be 4.3% in Q4 as a whole. A significant proportion of this
distribution lies below Bank staff’s current estimate of the long‑term equilibrium unemployment
rate. There is therefore uncertainty about the precise calibration of this fan chart.
36 Inflation Report February 2018
inflation falls gradually but remains above the target in the
second and third years of the forecast period (Chart 5.3).
At its meeting ending on 7 February 2018, the MPC voted to
maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%, to maintain the stock of sterling
non‑financial investment‑grade corporate bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at £10 billion
and to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases,
financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at
£435 billion. The factors behind that decision are set out in the
Monetary Policy Summary on pages i–ii of this Report, and in
more detail in the Minutes of the meeting. The remainder of
this section sets out the MPC’s projections, and the risks
around them, in more detail.
5.1 The MPC’s key judgements and risks
Key Judgement 1: the broad‑based strength in global
growth continues
Growth has picked up significantly across many economies
over the past two years. The outlook for global growth appears
to have strengthened somewhat further over the past
three months. The current pace of quarterly growth is judged
likely to persist at least over 2018, a stronger projection than
in November (Chart 5.5).
In the euro area, above‑trend growth has been supported by
the accommodative stance of monetary policy, an easing in
credit conditions, and reduced fiscal drag, alongside a steady
rise in business and consumer confidence. Unemployment has
fallen further, to its lowest level since 2009, though a
significant degree of slack still appears to remain. These
factors are projected to support continued above‑trend annual
average growth in 2018 at around 2¾%, compared with a
projection of 2¼% in November.

Chart 5.3 CPI inflation projection based on market
interest rate expectations, other policy measures as
announced
Charts 5.3 and 5.4 depict the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future. They have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b). If economic circumstances identical to today’s
were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan charts are constructed
so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the
fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the light grey
background. See the box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 37
In the United States, growth has also been robust in recent
quarters. The tax cuts announced at the end of 2017 are likely
to provide a greater and more immediate stimulus to spending
than anticipated in November. That, combined with
supportive financial conditions (Section 1), suggests a
continuation of the current strong pace of quarterly growth in
2018 at around ¾%. Annual average growth is projected to
accelerate to 3% in 2018, compared with a central forecast of
2¼% in the November projections.
Strengthening advanced‑economy growth, alongside stable
growth in China and improving outlooks in other emerging
market economies, has led to a rise in some commodity prices.
Oil and industrial metals prices have risen to their highest
levels in several years. That will feed through into higher
headline inflation rates in many countries in coming months
and contribute to higher global export prices.
Based on PPP weights, global activity is projected to expand at
an annual average rate of just over 4% in 2018 before slowing
to 3½% by 2020 (Table 5.C) as remaining slack is absorbed
and global inflationary pressures build. Weighted by UK export
shares, growth is around 3% in 2018, slowing to 2¼% by
2020. It is possible that the current momentum in global
growth could persist for longer than embodied in the central
projection. To the extent that it is matched by stronger global
productivity growth, and hence a faster pace of supply growth,
it would be unlikely to lead to additional global inflationary
pressure.
Key Judgement 2: the rotation in UK GDP growth away
from domestic consumption and towards external demand
and investment continues
In contrast to the strengthening in global growth, UK growth
has remained modest by historical standards. It picked up in
Q4 and was stronger than expected (Section 2). Four‑quarter
GDP growth is projected to average around 1¾% over the
forecast period (Chart 5.1), supported by strong global growth
(Key Judgement 1) and a lessening drag from the fiscal
consolidation following the measures announced in the
November Budget. That is a slightly stronger near‑term
outlook than in November (Table 5.B).
Brexit is affecting both the level and composition of
UK demand. The fall in sterling’s exchange rate since late 2015
reflects financial market participants’ judgements about the
likely impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom’s prospects.
That fall has boosted consumer prices (Key Judgement 4) and
depressed households’ real incomes and spending. Households
typically adjust their spending only gradually to changes in
real income. While real income has fallen over the past year,
four‑quarter consumption growth has remained positive,
slowing to around 1%, and the saving ratio has fallen.

38 Inflation Report February 2018
Consumption growth is projected to remain subdued but
stable over the next three years (Table 5.D), broadly in line
with aggregate income growth such that the saving ratio
remains broadly unchanged (Chart 5.6). Although the past fall
in real income will continue to weigh on consumption, there
are a number of factors supporting the current pace of growth.
The contribution of import prices to inflation has probably
peaked (Key Judgement 4). That, combined with a rise in
nominal pay growth, will support some recovery in household
real income growth (Table 5.E). Consumer confidence is only a
little below past averages. Housing market activity slowed
slightly in Q4, which combined with the recent fall in new
housing starts is likely to drag on growth in housing
investment in 2018 (Section 2).
In contrast to the weakness in consumption growth, net trade
is expected to have made a significant positive contribution to
GDP growth in 2017, supported by the strength in world
demand and the past depreciation of sterling. Strong world
demand, a low cost of capital, the high rates of return on
capital and diminishing spare capacity have all supported
business investment. Nevertheless, the drag from uncertainty
around Brexit (see Box 3) has meant that investment growth
has been notably weaker than in previous expansions.
In the central projection, the more persistent strength in
global demand (Key Judgement 1) supports net trade, which
continues to provide a significant boost to GDP growth
(Table 5.C). That, in turn, leads to a gradual narrowing in the
current account deficit to around 3¾% of GDP by the end of
the forecast period. Alongside that, business investment
growth picks up, also supported by global demand and
intensifying capacity pressures. The outlook for business
investment will remain sensitive to developments in and
companies’ perceptions of the United Kingdom’s future
trading arrangements.
The risks around the projection for GDP growth are skewed to
the upside, stemming from the upside risks to global growth.
The recent momentum in global growth may persist for longer
than in the central projection (Key Judgement 1), and the
boost to demand for UK goods and services from global
demand could prove greater than anticipated.
Key Judgement 3: very little slack remains and the pace of
potential supply growth is modest
The speed at which demand can grow before it puts upward
pressure on inflation depends on the degree of spare capacity
in the economy and on the rate of growth of potential supply.
In recent years, elevated unemployment meant there was a
significant degree of slack in the economy and demand could
grow more quickly than potential supply without generating
inflationary pressures. As unemployment has fallen and slack
has been absorbed, the pace at which demand can grow has
become increasingly dependent on the pace of potential
supply growth.

Section 5 Prospects for inflation 39
In the run-up to this Report, the MPC completed its annual
reassessment of supply‑side conditions. The MPC judges that
very little spare capacity remains. A range of evidence suggests
that unemployment is close to its long‑term equilibrium rate,
which is now estimated to be 4¼%, slightly lower than
estimated a year ago (see Box 4). Within companies, there
appears to be some scope to increase output by raising the
average number of hours worked by employees, but indicators
suggest there is little capacity for companies to work their
other resources more intensively (Section 3).
The MPC continues to judge that growth in potential supply
will remain modest, relative to pre‑crisis norms, at around
1½%. An important contributor to potential supply growth in
recent decades has been population growth, which has been
driven by strong net inward migration flows. Net inward
migration has slowed over the past 18 months and, under the
ONS’s population projections on which the MPC’s forecasts
are conditioned, net migration slows slightly further in coming
years. There is a risk that net migration will slow more sharply,
Table 5.E Monitoring risks to the Committee’s key judgements
The Committee’s projections are underpinned by four key
judgements. Risks surround all of these, and the MPC will
monitor a broad range of variables to assess the degree to
which the risks are crystallising. The table below shows

40 Inflation Report February 2018
however, reducing potential supply growth more materially
(see Box 5).
Prior to the financial crisis, productivity growth was the largest
driver of potential supply growth. In common with many other
advanced economies, productivity growth in the UK has been
persistently weak in recent years. Part of that global weakness
is likely to reflect weak investment, which fell during the crisis
and has only recovered gradually since then. As such, growth
in the capital stock — the resources and equipment available
for workers to produce output and a key driver of productivity
— has been subdued. The weakness in productivity growth
also appears to reflect weak growth in total factor productivity
(TFP) — the efficiency with which companies use their labour
and capital to produce output. The expansion in global trade
and broadening of supply chains in the decade prior to the
crisis is likely to have been one factor contributing to robust
TFP growth during that period. Since then, growth in global
trade and TFP have both been subdued.
Structural productivity growth is projected to pick up to just
over 1% in 2019–20, broadly unchanged from the November
projections. While that represents a pickup from the pace of
productivity growth since the financial crisis, it is still around
half the pre‑crisis rate. Companies’ anticipation of and
response to post‑Brexit trading relationships are likely to
weigh on UK productivity growth. Uncertainty around Brexit
appears to be holding back some investment (see Box 3) and
any reduction in openness is also likely to weigh on TFP growth
(Section 3). As explained in Box 6, although there has been
little change to the MPC’s judgement about the outlook for
structural productivity growth, the profile for actual output
per hour worked is lower than in the November projections (Table 5.C). Limited scope for companies to work their capital
more intensively (Section 3) means output per hour worked
now grows broadly in line with structural productivity.
There are significant risks in both directions to the outlook for
productivity. Productivity growth has serially disappointed
over the past decade and, in common with other forecasters,
the MPC has marked down its forecasts numerous times. As
such, it could fail to pick up by even the modest amounts
assumed. Set against that, productivity, although volatile, has
tended to grow by around 2% on average for many decades.
Productivity could ultimately pick up by more than expected,
particularly if there is a global upswing in trade and investment
that benefits the United Kingdom.
Key Judgement 4: with demand outstripping potential
supply, domestic inflationary pressures continue to build
while the contribution from energy and import prices
dissipates
At 3% in December, inflation remains above the MPC’s
2% target, and the 3.1% outturn in November necessitated an
exchange of letters between the Governor and the Chancellor, 
Section 5 Prospects for inflation 41
published alongside this Report. That overshoot was almost
entirely due to the effects of higher import prices as a result of
the past depreciation in sterling, though the recent rise in oil
prices has also contributed. And it is possible that inflation
could rise back above 3% temporarily.
Increases in global oil prices (Key Judgement 1) tend to be
passed on to higher fuel prices quite quickly. The MPC’s
projections are conditioned on spot oil prices following the
market futures curve, which is currently downward sloping
(Table 5.C). The implied easing back in oil prices means that
energy prices are weighing on inflation from the end of 2018.
The rise in non‑energy import prices due to the depreciation in
sterling will take several years to be passed on to consumer
prices. Import prices have so far risen by slightly less than
anticipated, given past experience (Section 4). Over the
forecast period, import prices are assumed to make up that
shortfall (Chart 5.7). Although the contribution from import
prices to CPI inflation is likely to have peaked, import prices are
projected to continue to push up inflation by around
½ percentage point over 2019 before that contribution
diminishes further. Import prices are still pushing up inflation at
the end of the three‑year forecast period, but the recent
appreciation of sterling means they contribute slightly less
than projected in November, at just under ¼ percentage point.

Box 6
Revisions to the MPC’s productivity
projections
Following the MPC’s annual reassessment of supply‑side
conditions, potential supply growth over the forecast period is
judged to be around 1½%, the same as in the November
projections. Within that, the outlook for structural
productivity growth is also broadly unchanged. But changes in
the composition of spare capacity in the economy mean the
MPC’s projections for measured productivity — output per
hour worked — have been revised down relative to November
(Table 5.C). As explained in this box, that revision does not
affect the outlook for trend growth over the forecast.
Structural labour productivity growth is a fundamental driver
of potential supply growth in the economy and, hence, the
pace of demand growth consistent with balanced inflationary
pressures. It is determined by factors such as the availability of
physical capital like buildings and IT equipment, and human
capital like experience and education. Measured productivity
— actual output per hour worked — can, however, temporarily
deviate from its structural level for cyclical reasons. For
example, if firms are underutilising their capital due to
previous weakness in demand then there is scope for output to
grow without an increase in the number of hours employees
work. As demand recovers and firms use up that spare
capacity, output per hour will grow even if structural
productivity is unchanged. Output per hour worked could also
rise above structural productivity if firms experience a
temporary boost in demand for the goods and services they
produce that leads them to operate above normal capacity
levels, which would tend to lead to inflationary pressure.
In the November Report, growth in measured productivity —
output per hour worked — was projected to rise to just over
1¼% over the forecast period (Table 5.C). Companies were
judged to have some scope to increase their capital utilisation
and around ¼ percentage point of the projected rise in
productivity growth reflected companies using up that spare
capacity. The rest of the pickup in productivity growth
reflected a rise in structural productivity.
In this Report, the MPC has reassessed its view of the
composition of slack remaining in the economy. With almost
no spare capacity judged to be remaining in companies’ capital
utilisation, output per hour worked is projected to grow
broadly in line with structural productivity. As explained in
Key Judgement 3, the outlook for structural productivity
growth is broadly unchanged from the November projections
and embodies a rise to just over 1% over the forecast period
(Table 5.C).

42 Inflation Report February 2018
There is a risk, however, that the contribution from import
prices to inflation diminishes more rapidly than in the central
projection. The more time that passes since the depreciation,
the less likely it is that the shortfall in import prices relative to
the size of the depreciation will be made up, and the greater
the risk that import prices contribute slightly less to inflation
over the forecast period.
As the effects from import and energy prices dissipate,
inflation is supported by rising domestic inflationary pressures.
The largest domestic component of companies’ costs is labour.
Although annual pay growth has been relatively subdued in
recent years, it picked up by more than expected towards the
end of 2017 and shorter‑term measures suggest a further
marked rise in annual pay growth in 2018 Q1 (Section 4).
Indicators, including the recent Agents’ annual pay survey,
suggest pay growth is rising in response to the past tightening
in the labour market and greater recruitment difficulties. The
outlook for pay growth is stronger than in November
(Table 5.D).
What matters for companies’ costs is how fast pay grows
relative to productivity — in other words, growth in their unit
labour costs (ULCs). As productivity growth has been weak,
unit labour cost growth has been much less subdued than pay
growth. In the central projection, with unemployment falling
slightly further (Chart 5.2), pay growth picks up, continuing to
outstrip rising productivity growth (Key Judgement 3), and
supporting somewhat firmer ULC growth (Table 5.C). There is
a risk, however, that building pressure in the labour market
leads to a more marked rise in pay and ULC growth over the
forecast period.
The stronger outlook for demand growth (Key Judgement 2)
coupled with modest potential supply growth
(Key Judgement 3), means that the limited remaining degree
of spare capacity in the economy is absorbed more quickly
than in the November projections. In the central projection,
under a conditioning path that embodies just under three
further 25 basis point rises in Bank Rate over the next
three years, a small margin of excess demand emerges by
early 2020 and builds thereafter. Domestic inflationary
pressures firm while the contribution from energy and import
prices dissipates, and inflation remains above the target in the
second and third years of the forecast period (Table 5.F).
5.2 The projections for demand,
unemployment and inflation
Based on the judgements above and the risks around them,
under the market path for Bank Rate and the assumption of an
unchanged stock of purchased assets, the MPC projects
four‑quarter GDP growth to average around 1¾% over the
next three years (Table 5.B). That projection is slightly

(a) The table shows the projections for annual average GDP growth rates of modal, median and mean
projections for four‑quarter growth of real GDP implied by the fan chart. Where growth rates depend in part
on the MPC’s backcast, revisions to quarterly growth are assumed to be independent of the revisions to
previous quarters. The figures in parentheses show the corresponding projections in the November 2017
Inflation Report. The projections have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b).
Section 5 Prospects for inflation 43
stronger in the near term than in November (Chart 5.8).
Consumption growth is projected to remain subdued relative
to historical norms, partially offset by a positive contribution
from net trade and a pickup in investment growth. The risks
around the central projection are judged to lie to the upside
(Table 5.G), stemming from the possibility of a greater boost
from global demand.
The economy’s potential supply capacity is projected to grow
at a modest pace over the forecast period, lower than
historical norms. There is judged to be only a very small degree
of slack at the start of the forecast period. With demand
growing faster than potential supply, that slack is fully
absorbed and the economy moves into excess demand by
early 2020. Unemployment is projected to fall slightly further
(Chart 5.2), below its equilibrium rate.
Inflation is currently above the MPC’s 2% target due to the
effect of higher import prices following sterling’s depreciation.
While the contribution from energy weighs on inflation from
the end of 2018, higher import prices are judged likely to push
up inflation throughout the forecast period albeit to a
diminishing degree. As those external price pressures wane,
domestic inflationary pressures continue to build and, under
the market path for Bank Rate, inflation is judged likely to
remain above the 2% target in the second and third years of
the forecast period (Chart 5.9). The risks around that
projection are judged to be balanced (Chart 5.10).
Chart 5.11 and Chart 5.12 show the MPC’s projections under
the alternative constant rate assumption and an unchanged
stock of purchased assets. That assumption holds Bank Rate at
0.5% throughout the three years of the forecast period, before
it rises towards the market path over the subsequent
three years. Under that path, GDP growth is stronger and
inflation ends the forecast period further above the target.

(a) Chart 5.10 represents the cross‑section of the CPI inflation fan chart in 2020 Q1 for the
market interest rate projection. The grey outline represents the corresponding cross‑section
of the November 2017 Inflation Report fan chart for the market interest rate projection.
The projections have been conditioned on the assumptions in Table 5.B footnote (b).
The coloured bands in Chart 5.10 have a similar interpretation to those on the fan charts.
Like the fan charts, they portray the central 90% of the probability distribution.
(b) Average probability within each band; the figures on the y‑axis indicate the probability of
inflation being within ±0.05 percentage points of any given inflation rate, specified to
one decimal place.

Box 7
Other forecasters’ expectations
This box reports the results of the Bank’s most recent survey
of external forecasters, carried out in January.(1) On average,
respondents expected four‑quarter GDP growth to slow a little
further over the coming year, before picking up to 1¾% in
three years’ time (Table 1). Relative to expectations
three months ago, that average GDP growth forecast was
broadly unchanged at the one and two‑year horizons but
weaker further ahead (Chart A). External forecasters, on
average, continued to expect a small rise in unemployment,
but to a lower level than three months ago.
External forecasters’ central expectations for CPI inflation at
the one and two‑year horizons were, on average, lower than
three months ago. On average, external forecasters placed
around a 50% probability on inflation being at or above the
2% target in two years’ time, lower than the 60% average
probability placed on that outcome three months ago (Chart B).
External forecasters, on average, expected somewhat less
monetary stimulus over the next three years than they did at
the time of the November Report, broadly consistent with the
steepening of the market‑implied path for Bank Rate
(Chart C). As in November, almost all forecasters expected
the current stock of gilt and corporate bond purchases to
remain unchanged over the next three years.
