Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
Noreena Hertz, ITV News: Governor, back in August the forecast for GDP for this year
was 0.8%. Now it's being forecast at 2.0%. That's a really
hefty adjustment. What went wrong with your initial
forecast?
Mark Carney: Well, I'd turn it around and say - what went right? What
went right first was policy actions that were taken by the
Bank, then policy action that was taken by the Chancellor, by
the government, both of which provide support into 2017. I
think, and I wouldn't overstate this, but our sense in terms of
the transmission of both the macroprudential measures - the
lowering of the countercyclical buffer and the monetary policy
measures that we took was that they have had more traction
than we would have expected at the time.
Now you could say that we should have anticipated it at the
time, but they had more of an impact than we expected at
the time.
The second thing that's gone right is that the global economy
has been stronger and that also helps support growth in
2017.
I think the thing that we missed is the strength of consumer
spending and consumer confidence associated with that, that
was present - has been present all the way through this
process. So after an initial wobble in terms of consumer
surveys, confidence surveys and other indicators in the
immediate aftermath of the referendum in the depths of the
summer, it bounced back pretty quickly. And you don't see it
in the data and in the activity of consumers.
So consumers have not been affected by any of the
associated uncertainty around Brexit. And that is to a large
degree understandable. I mean, the labour market is still
holding up, wages are growing roughly the same rate -
modestly - but roughly the same rate as they had in the past. 
Page 3
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
And in part because of our actions, credit is available and it's
cheap, if it's needed.
Now that dynamic will start to be tested as this year
progresses. The consumer dynamic will start to be tested as
this year progresses, as real incomes move from growing
closer to 3% to growing closers to 0%, if our forecast is
broadly correct. And the question will be - with what speed
do consumers adjust their spending this year?
In this forecast, in the very near term this quarter, we
actually anticipate less of an adjustment than we had in
November. The bigger news to the forecast though as you
progress through 2017 is, if you will, external. It's better
world, bigger fiscal, better financial conditions which make
the difference. So that's the delta.
Kamal Ahmed, BBC: Governor, you've spoken about inflation risk. Obviously one
way to control inflation risk is interest rates. Lots of people
will have mortgages, lots of people will be considering a
house purchase this year. Can you tell them, compared to
the last Inflation Report, is there more of a risk of an interest
rate rise than there is of a further interest rate cut?
Mark Carney: Well, what we - first thing we've just taken a decision and
obviously, we haven't changed interest rates. So that's the
most concrete thing we can say.
We can see scenarios in either direction, and I gave an
example of perhaps we could have a sharper adjustment of
consumer spending. I would note that our forecast has a
quite sharp further reduction in the savings rate of
consumers, which is necessary to support the degree of
consumer spending that we have in it.
That said, we have made some important assessment
judgements - in this forecast, one of which relates to the 
Page 4
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
degree of excess capacity in the economy or the slack in the
labour market. We think - and this is a good news story - we
think that the economy can run with a lower rate of
unemployment - more people can be in work without us
having to adjust policy.
Now that's a judgement. It's based on a lot of analysis. It's
based on, as I said in my opening remarks, a series of
overestimations of wages that we have made over the last
several years.
But we'll find out much about the accuracy of that, if the
economy continues to grow roughly at rates similar. And if
we do see a situation where there is faster growth than
wages than we anticipate, or that spending doesn't decelerate
later in the year as that real income squeeze comes, or some
combination of those. One could anticipate that there would
be an adjustment of interest rates, an increase in interest
rates - that is not a signal; that is laying out some of the
factors that would influence it.
The other point I would make is that one of the differences
between now and November is that - to a very gentle degree
- the market has started to build in some increase in interest
rates over the course of the next few years. And of course,
we have conditioned our forecast on that, so when we talk
about policy could go in either direction, it's either direction
relative to the market curve, if you will, or the market path of
interest rates that are in.
Chris Giles, Financial Times: Governor, the big picture here is that you've revised up
demand and you've revised up slack. They exactly offset
each other so you don't have to do anything on policy. People
might say that's convenient. Reasonable people could
disagree about both the judgements on demand and on
supply.
Page 5
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
You've got nine reasonable people on your Committee who've
all come to exactly the same judgement. Does this worry
you?
Mark Carney: Two things. One a not unimportant detail. The other part of
the puzzle, or the equation, if you will, is there has been
some appreciation of sterling - 3% appreciation of sterling.
As I just said to Kamal, there also has been some - the
market path has some increase in interest rates, both of
which help ensure a similar trade-off between the two.
In terms of - you know, there's a range of view on the
Committee, both on the strength of demand and the degree
of slack and the risks around the trade-off that we are
striking. So, in other words, and so those risks around the
trade-off relate to - by and large - the risks around the
economic forecast.
One can paint scenarios, as you just alluded to, where the
economy has more momentum or has less momentum or the
labour market has more or less slack. But, you know, the
balance of judgement is that the stance is appropriate. No, it
doesn't worry me because these are judgements that are -
we have come to on the basis of vigorous debate, vigorous,
detailed analysis of the issues.
And we I think share a view both of the main forces acting on
the economy, the framework for analysing those, the tradeoff
we're broadly trying to strike and we will be - those
opinions will evolve with time. And it's reasonable to expect
that different people will come to different conclusions at
different times, as the economy moves forward and the
degree of uncertainty reduces.
So just because we agree today doesn't mean that we would
agree at the next meeting or subsequent meetings. That's
the way it works.

Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
Ed Conway, Sky News: Governor, for some people perhaps the most alarming chart
in the Report would be the one on page 36, of the savings
ratio. Are you and the Bank really relaxed about the savings
ratio going down to the lowest level on record? And given that
you have dropped interest rate to the lowest level since 1694,
are you not in some way part of that, complicit, if not
responsible?
Mark Carney: Well, the - distinguish between the savings ratio and
consumer borrowing, and certainly the adjustments to
macroprudential policy capital rules and the adjustments to
monetary policy encourage borrowing. Those who are saving
less out of income are making a judgement about their future
incomes, to put it in the simplest terms, and may have a
more positive view of their future incomes than - well, time
will tell whether those views of future incomes come to pass.
I think what I would say about the savings ratio - our view on
the savings ratio is we view this as plausible on current
trends. It does show that there are two-sided risks around
our forecast for household spending. It certainly - one could
see scenarios where, because of shocks or just because of -
for other reasons where people decide not collectively to draw
savings down to the same extent, which would mean slower
growth, more slack in the economy and have implications for,
at least domestically, generated inflation.
In terms of - I'm going to say a word on household
borrowing, if I may, which is - we look at this from an
institutional perspective. We start from a very basic premise,
which is that any time you see a credit aggregate grow
rapidly, accelerate, you should dig into it and try to
understand better the dynamics behind it. How long it's
going to persist, is it sustainable? And the pick-up in
unsecured consumer credit, which I would include auto. We
can debate about whether to include auto leases in that, but 
Page 7
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
we've included auto leases in that. That falls into that camp
and it falls into the camp at least initially of the FPC and the
PRA. The MPC takes interest in it because of what it may say
about the pace of consumption going forward.
So you can expect that the FPC and the PRA are taking a look
at underwriting standards, the sustainability of this, all the
things we should be doing - and we have been doing, in
fairness, with previous stress tests.
From an MPC perspective, just to put those numbers into
context, on the most expansive definition, the increase in
consumer borrowing would contribute up to a tenth of the
increase in consumption. So it's something, but it's not
everything. This is not a debt-fuelled consumer expansion
that we're dealing with.
Now that doesn't mean we shouldn't focus on the issue more
broadly with our institutional responsibilities, but the bigger
picture is- where you started your question, which is around
households' willingness to draw down savings during a period
where real incomes are being squeezed.
The last thing I will say on that is that one of the reasons why
they might want to do that is that we are going through a
period for a few years where we have higher inflation because
of pass-through of a weaker exchange rate. And the two will
pass, and so households may take a decision to look through
that. But it's a big judgement.
Phil Aldrick, The Times: Governor, Theresa May has laid out some more clarity on her
position for negotiations with Europe, and I just wonder - I
mean, obviously this has serious economic implications in
terms of membership of the single market. And I wondered
how that position may affect your forecasts going forward or
whether it's been factored in already?
Page 8
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
Mark Carney: Yes. So, the short answer is - we haven't changed our
judgement for the purposes of this forecast about the long
term resting place for our relationships with Europe and other
potential trading partners. And the reason we haven't is a
couple-fold.
The first thing is the Prime Minister laid out really a range of
potential alternatives. At one end of the spectrum was a
walk-away position equivalent to a WTO-type position. And
the other end of the spectrum was an ambitious, bold,
comprehensive trading arrangement with Europe which - and
also, while not being in the customs union would have
customs union-like characteristics - potentially.
So that's a wide range. Entirely understandable why, and it
would be a false position for us to try to narrow that gap
before the negotiations even began. And then on top of that,
as you're well aware, the country's begun initial exploratory
discussions with a range of other countries about potential
new trading arrangements to follow after the exit from the
EU.
Which gets me to my next point. Of course the bigger impact
of all these is offstage, if you will, from this forecast. In other
words, they actually take effect in all likelihood - likelihood,
not certainty – beyond the forecast horizon.
And the effect on supply, particularly, is predominantly
determined - at least in a judgement that we make - by firms'
investments plans - changes to firms' investment plans in
anticipation of those potential arrangements.
And as I said in my opening comments, you know, we do
have - at least the uncertainty around those potential
arrangements has a pretty material impact on investment.
It's about a quarter lower than it would have been according
to our May forecast, our sort of undisturbed forecast. And 
Page 9
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
that has some impact on productivity, it has some impact on
the capacity in the economy and therefore inflation.
But those impacts, as you can appreciate, are dwarfed by the
ultimate impacts on the economy of the ultimate deals that
are struck. So it would be false precision to refine it is our
judgement, and I suspect - I can't bind the Committee - but I
suspect that will continue to be our judgement as the
negotiations progress over the coming years, because one
thing about trade deals is that they're never agreed till
everything's agreed. So it's not clear we'll be that much
better informed on the final outcome.
And the key judgements we will have to make is about the
scale of business reaction to those possibilities and what it
means, particularly for productivity but also for hiring.
Helia Ibrahimi, Channel 4 News: Governor, this week we had a rather unprecedented
intervention from President Trump's economic advisor which
moved the currency markets. I wonder if you could reflect on
whether it's becoming more difficult to be a central banker
when political commentary is becoming more and more
influential and more unpredictable, and specifically whether
you think it's right for politicians to criticise other
governments' currency policies?
Mark Carney: Well, let me see how I can get out of that. I think they -
what I'd say is that, in many respects we're coming to the
last seconds of central bankers' 15 minutes of fame, to use
the, you know the Warhol line, which is a good thing.
Because we're moving more - I talked, in this forecast and
my opening comments – I mentioned fiscal policy a couple of
times, for the UK a notable increase to growth because of the
Autumn Statement and our judgement in other economies'
rotation to fiscal policy. That's positive; it's a more balanced
policy mix. Also, structural policy is becoming more 
Page 10
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
important, trade policy - clearly important here and
elsewhere.
And that, just in general, is a much better balance than - to
use the over used phrase - than the only game in town being
central banks and monetary policy. So this is positive; so I'm
not going to quibble about specific comments at specific times
in what is a you know, a generally positive direction of travel.
And you know, as members of the MPC - Ben, Minouche and
my other responsibilities - you know our job is to take other
policies as given and then optimise around those, or respond
to those policies. And that's what we'll do, whether it's UK
policy or the policy of our major trading partners.
Larry Elliott, The Guardian: I'd like to ask you a question about the labour market and
your view of the labour market, where you seem to have
accepted that the analysis by the former MPC member,
Professor Blanchflower, is more accurate than your own have
been in the last few years.
But just as a way of asking this question, is it really plausible
that - with the labour market pretty tight, some indication
that there's been a fall in the number of migrant workers
coming to the UK, some evidence of skill shortages - that
people in the UK are not going to try and bid up the price of
their labour as their living standards start to be eroded in the
course of the next couple of years? Isn't it more likely that
they're going to try and push up wages as they are in the US?
Mark Carney: Well, it's certainly possible, and the question is whether that's
the most likely scenario. And I'll say a couple of things and
then pass to Ben in terms of what specifically we - how we
made our judgements on the labour market side.
But we have been looking quite hard at the wage puzzle in
the UK, and we have examined a series of candidate 
Page 11
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
explanations which helped explain part of it, but never the
whole. So the composition of the labour force was one
element; the impact of inflation expectations on wage rounds
was another element.
But even controlling for these factors we still had big, so
called wage residuals. And I'll put a number on it. If you
took any of our wage forecasts in 2015, the four wage
forecasts for 2016 wage growth, they overestimated by 1%
to 1.5%. So these are big, you know these are big
differences, and that's part of how we got to the judgement.
In terms of where wage pressure is - and there's a variety of
surveys on that - I mean, we feel pretty comfortable as a
central expectation. The one piece of information I'll give you
on the other side just to balance it, and I wouldn't overweight
this, but it is referenced in the Report, which is that our Agent
surveys of wage settlements suggested a pretty marked
deceleration of wage settlements this year - so going broad
brush, from 3% to about 2%.
Now I wouldn’t overweight that because that's only a subset
of the market. It has been a pretty good indicator in the
past, but of course every time something is a good indicator
in the past and you mention it at one of these press
conferences, it's by definition no longer relevant. So we'll
stop doing that survey from now on.
But no, we are picking up, we're not picking up a lot of that
yet. And so I think the point - and then I'll pass to Ben on
the specifics - but the point that we were trying to make in
the MPS and I made in the opening statement, is that we will
be looking quite closely at what happens to regular pay.
Because we've made this big judgement, and if a world
transpires like you're suggesting, that will have implications
for the stance of - that could well have implications for - the 
Page 12
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
stance of policy. So it's right to spend time on it. So how did
we get there, Ben?
Ben Broadbent: I don’t think I've got much more to add. I mean the
Governor is right; the main piece of evidence is the relatively
subdued rate of wage growth over a number of years. I
mean - we talked about this as a Committee as long ago as
four or five years ago. We mentioned specifically the
possibility of a lower equilibrium rate a year or so ago, and
again last May. And now that we do these regular annual
assessments of supply, we had the opportunity to look at it
more in depth.
You're right that, I mean the main piece of evidence that
would suggest risk to that view in the direction you indicate is
the level of vacancies. There's a chart showing those. We
think now, having done quite a lot of work in this, that that
piece of evidence is mitigated somewhat - I won't go into the
technicalities as to why - by certain demographic changes in
the labour force, including gradual increase in average
educational attainment. But the main reason is the lower
level of wage growth than we'd forecast.
Specifically, with reference to your point you made about
rising inflation and the response to that, that's clearly a risk,
although this is a slightly different situation from one in which
the inflation is domestically generated.
If you've got a rise in prices, the benefit of which goes to
British firms, then they can afford to pay higher wages. The
difference in this case, as indeed it was in 2009, is that it's
import prices that are going up and the benefit of that doesn't
go to British firms. And indeed if you look at the survey of
the Agents to which the Governor referred, they do cite that
as one of the factors, that firms say - well, we simply can't
afford to compensate everybody for the rise in import prices.
Page 13
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
Now there are risks around this, and that is why we flag it as
one of our key judgements. You know, there was a range of
views on the Committee about how low this number should
be, and it's a pretty important judgement. And, you know, I
think there are risks on both sides. So we will be watching
pay growth, notably regular pay growth - the underlying rate
of pay growth - quite closely over coming months. We do
expect a little bit of an acceleration, I should say, we do
expect wage growth to rise, but not by that much.
Ben Chu, The Independent: Governor, you've conceded that the main reason, the
dominant reason why the Bank's forecasts last August were
wrong was because the Bank did not foresee that consumers
would carry on spending the way they did after the Brexit
vote. How worried are you about the Bank's misjudgement
about consumer psychology in that way? Do you think that
this means you should have a fundamental revisit of the
Bank's models? Most people, after getting a big call like that
wrong, would naturally be pretty nervous about the next call
they had to make, so how nervous are you?
Mark Carney: I'm not. No, look, I think the - last summer we were in
pretty exceptional circumstances. A big decision had been
taken; we did not yet have a clear course for how to
implement that decision from the Government, the
Government was just being formed.
You had a sharp, a sharp fall in business and consumer
confidence, on any survey, on any measure. And it was - and
you had a sharp fall in financial market measures as well. So
unidirectional view of - at least near term where the, in terms
of survey measures - there were people who had different
views - but if you had any sort of aggregate measure,
whether it was GFK surveys, whether it was CIPS surveys,
whether it was asset prices, said the same thing.
Page 14
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
And so the question - and on top of that an understanding
that there would be a period of adjustment that necessarily
would happen and that that in and of itself was likely to weigh
a bit on demand as businesses had to hesitate in terms of
investment, something we're seeing, and it would have -
could have knock-on effects.
So the judgement of the Committee, which has a remit for
exactly such exceptional circumstance literally written into the
remit, that we should think about balancing the trade-off -
took the judgement, which in retrospect we think is correct,
because we've just confirmed the policy stance - even after
having very welcome news in terms of the strength of the
consumer and improved global economy, a fiscal response
from the Government, we still have the same policy stance.
So it's hard to then sit here and say - well we shouldn't have
done that.
And in fact, by doing it and, you know, I'm not going to
overstate the case, but there is a case that we helped support
the economy during an important time. And very importantly
given the way monetary policy transmits through to the
economy, we will help support the economy as the squeeze
starts to come in, this squeeze on real incomes starts to come
in this year and next year.
And during a period, where arguably the degree of relative
uncertainty about the ultimate outcome is elevated, because
it will be in the middle of negotiations, and so businesses may
be hesitating - we're seeing some evidence of that. We talk
to the business; it's entirely understandable. So we provided
that support for that period of time.
And we can always adjust policy from this position. But we
would be adjusting policy from a position of strength, a
position where the economy has grown, a position where 
Page 15
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
more people are in work, a position where people are getting
paid more. And that is a far, far better place to be.
And the last point here, which is I think very important to
stress, is that we are going to go - we're just starting this
period, we think this month will be the month where inflation
comes back to target, gets back to 2%. Now it will only be
there briefly because it's going to go above target. It is going
above target because the exchange rate has fallen 18%. And
the predominant reason why the exchange rate has fallen
18%, is because we are going through this process of leaving
the European Union. That is the market's judgement at
present of the appropriate level of the exchange rate, given
that process.
Now the market will constantly revise its judgement and you
know, in all likelihood - well I shouldn't predict, but certainly
circumstances where better arrangements struck with
Europe, better arrangements struck with other countries, the
adjustment process moves forward, the exchange rate
adjusts up, that's certainly reasonable. That's part of how
that tension between where the consumer is and the market
is can be resolved.
But given that judgement of the market, given the real
change that - fundamental change that is in prospect, we
took a decision to help support the necessary adjustment
during that. And it's still valid today because we've just
confirmed that appropriateness of the stance. Now we've laid
up potential conditions around how we might, if we had to
change, what would be particularly informative for that.
Ben Broadbent: I want to add one thing about the forecast for last year. I
mean, you know, unfortunately we didn’t need only the
experience of the second half of last year to tell us that
forecasting is a hazardous business when you've done it as
long as we have. 
Page 16
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
I would make a distinction, however, between - just because
you raised the question of models - between economic
models, which we use for forecasting over the medium term,
and the stuff we use for more short term forecasting which is
very different. It’s based on these survey measures because
they generally have a reasonable correlation with subsequent
moves and output. Those fell extremely steeply in July - as
steeply, if not more so - than anything we saw in the financial
crisis. That was overwhelmingly the reason for the
downgrade in growth we made, and indeed other forecasters,
almost all other forecasters I think, made a more aggressive
downgrade. We were amongst the very few not to forecast a
contraction in GDP in the third quarter of last year. We
aimed off; as it turns out we didn’t aim off by enough.
Now in the forecast - and we thought well, if we were to get
this severe weakening, how would it happen? And we
therefore said - you know, you fit the bits of demand into it.
But we don’t use economic models to forecast in the very
near term and nor do any forecasters. Now as it turns out
very happily, those surveys bounced back and looking
backwards, it looks like consumer spending, strong consumer
spending growth was the thing that most surprised us relative
to that August forecast. But we do them in a slightly different
way and they were extremely volatile.
And we take a look at the forecast as you know regularly, at
the forecast performance, and I think we’re doing another -
our annual assessment in May, at which point we probably
will look again at all the statistical evidence regarding the
links between the survey indicators and output.
Szu Chan, The Telegraph: Just a follow up on your comments on consumer debt. You
said that this is not a debt fuelled consumer expansion, you
outlined the reasons why, unsecured credit growth, the
annual pace has slowed. But on the other hand, one of your 
Page 17
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
scenarios is that consumers continue to buy things on credit.
You said at a recent FPC hearing that it would be a big call for
the FPC to tweak policy beyond ensuring the core system is
resilient. What would that big call involve and is this
ultimately a question for the FPC and not the MPC?
Mark Carney: Well, I think from a first order - yes, it is an FPC or a PRA call.
I think the first stance is to ensure whether it’s mortgage
underwriting or commercial real estate underwriting or
underwriting of consumer credit, that the standards are
appropriate. And if they had been appropriate that they’re
maintained; there's not that slide from responsible to
reckless. And that’s something that the PRA regularly
reviews and from time to time can do thematic reviews of
such issues.
From an FPC perspective, as you know, it’s on a longer time
horizon when you start to - if that first point is satisfied and
you’re confident that the financial institutions are adequately
capitalised against these risks - both because of capital and
because of underwriting standards - then the question
becomes are you growing - is the economy growing a bigger
and bigger group of people who are heavily indebted that will
face real trouble when the interest rate cycle turns? And as a
consequence of that, amplify the business cycle, so beyond
the monetary policy cycle.
It becomes an issue for the MPC really only - well not only,
but as part of a variety of indicators and drivers or supports
to broader consumer behaviour, as part of broader aggregate
demand, relative to supply, relative to inflation. So it’s - I
mean, of course we care about it, but it starts earlier up the
chain, and I would suggest that at this stage that it is more of
an issue for the PRA or the FPC than it is for the MPC.
There have been a number of questions quite rightly about
household spending, the track of spending relative to savings, 
Page 18
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
the risk both on the upside and the downside to that. We’ve
been seeing upside behaviour since August - Ben's question.
One can also anticipate that it could go the other way, which
is why we’re flagging this as a very key judgement.
David Smith, Sunday Times: Governor, you've talked quite a lot about labour market slack.
I just wanted to ask you about another measure of slack
which is spare capacity within firms. Three months ago you
thought there was substantial spare capacity within business;
now you think there's very little. Normally if firms don’t have
much spare capacity, they would invest and invest quite a lot
and clearly, for the reasons you've said, you don’t expect
that. So what are the consequences of very little spare
capacity within business and weak investment over the next
three years?
Mark Carney: Yes, it’s a good point. And in part that explains part of -
sorry, a slightly technical start to the answer which is that’s
part of the explanation of the revision to our productivity
forecast, which is the productivity benefit of using up that
spare capacity is not there with the judgement.
It is quite a weak or modest investment forecast here,
particularly given that investment has been - as I said at the
start - has been flat since the end of 2015. And it’s based on
our read of the surveys, it’s based on our conversations with
businesses across a range of industries and it’s based on
what is, we think, a reasonable judgement, which is that
during a period of uncertainty that - what we’re finding,
David, and be interested in what you’re seeing, but what
we’re finding is that, in general, projects that are either in
train, had been green lighted before if we use that term are
proceeding, including those that rely on a high degree of
access to the European Union.
But new projects, things that are still on the drawing board,
things that are coming up to the boardroom, if they have a 
Page 19
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
component that relies heavily on access - whether it’s up the
chain in the supply chain or down the chain in terms of people
buying the product or the service - are being deferred.
I mean, that’s understandable. And whereas for businesses
that are outside, don’t have exposure to Europe, have
exposure to the rest of the world, have the benefit of the
lower level of sterling, have access to credit and labour,
they’re unaffected by this. In fact, they’re quite bullish. So
you get a pretty mixed picture. All of that, on balance, leads
to this lower track for investment than we would have seen a
year ago.
But all of it, on balance, is in an economy that - at least with
our latest forecast - that’s growing 1.6%, 1.7% over the
course of the next two years. So it’s significant but I wouldn’t
overstate it. And if there's clarity towards the end of that
time horizon about access, there could be some significant
pent-up investment demand to put it on the other side, and
certainly businesses are ready to adjust when they know
what they’re adjusting to.
Scott Hamilton, Bloomberg News: Governor, you mentioned earlier about market expectations
for interest rates have risen since November, in fact they’ve
risen quite markedly. These forecasts are based on markets
pricing in a full 25 basis point interest rate rise by early 2019,
and in fact they’ve risen even further since then, now pricing
in a rate hike by the end of 2018. Do you think that market
pricing is appropriate, especially considering that implies an
interest rate rise just months ahead of Brexit? Could the
Bank of England really raise rates just months ahead of
Brexit?
Mark Carney: I’ll make the general point which is that we will calibrate
policy appropriately regardless of the timetable. Obviously,
we take into account major events, but I'm not going to
comment on the specific day-to-day moves of the market. 
Page 20
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
But I will make the general observation, as the Committee
has, that this forecast is conditioned, as you said, on a
market curve that has a gently rising rate of interest rates
and that there are two-sided risks around that.
So when we talk about scenarios with consumer borrowing -
or sorry consumer spending - or that there may be less
labour market slack or that exchange rate pass-through
doesn’t come through exactly as we expect and we realise the
upside risks, then you know, it’s possible that policy would be
tighter than that path. Now that’s not a promise and it’s not
a prediction, it’s not guidance on it, but the Committee will
take the decisions it needs to do. And what it’s tried to do
consistently, in advance of the referendum and in subsequent
forecasts and today, is to flag as much as possible the key
drivers and the way it is thinking about the trade-off it has to
strike.
So as much as possible we’re trying to give you, the market
and the British people, the information they need to judge
what we would do if the economy performs better and there's
more inflationary pressures or if the converse happens.
Eric Albert, Le Monde: I just wanted to come back to something you said in front of
the Treasury Select Committee a couple of weeks ago, that
there are greater financial stability risks on the Continent in
the short term for the transition compared to risks in the UK.
Now I mean, there is no doubt that there are a lot of EU
corporations getting financing in the City here, but big banks
have said they would be moving jobs - UBS, HSBC.
Therefore that finance will be where the clients need them.
That would tend to show that, if finance does move, that the
financial stability risk for the EU is not that big and indeed
maybe it might be bigger for the UK than for the rest of the
EU.

Mark Carney: I totally disagree with your logic. The core of this activity to
which you referred - and let’s take derivative markets, the
front end of derivative markets not the back end, not the
clearing - is highly complex, highly interrelated and needs to
be intensively and continuously supervised. And the ability to
pick that up and move it to another jurisdiction, people,
capital, models, collateral, that is a very, very complicated
exercise, there is huge operational risk involved in that,
there's huge financial risk involved in that. It’s not something
you do overnight.
When we have an individual institution, and more of this
business is concentrated in London than anywhere else in the
world. In fact, 40% of the business is concentrated in London
globally - not European, globally. Three quarters of European
business here, but 40% globally. So when we have an
institution, major global institution who reorganises itself and
has to move people, capital and trading books, collateral into
the UK arm, in order to do it right, it can take up to four
years for one institution. We’re talking about moving the
whole activity in extreme scenarios.
Now the one thing I know is the capacity is here, the
collateral is here, the people are here, the capital is here, the
expertise is here, the supervisory ability is here, the clearing
is here. So the one jurisdiction that is going to have capacity
is the UK. What we need to do as regulators, as authorities,
is - within whatever is agreed - is to try to smooth whatever
transition needs to happen. But it shouldn’t be
underestimated how to do this. And if it is done conveniently
with workarounds, then one's taking black box risk in the
jurisdiction that accepts the workaround.
Harry Daniels, Live Squawk News: Good afternoon, Governor. Just going back to the global
picture, E3 baseline is for continued easing this year, while
the third baseline is pricing three heights throughout the
course of this year. How does this complicate policy outlook 
Page 22
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
for the Bank of England? How do you weigh each of those
diverging policy regimes?
Mark Carney: Well, Harry, that I mean - those potential policy paths are
incorporated in asset prices and market prices and they fold
into our forecast. Let me give you one example of this.
I said at the outset, and we say in the Report, that one of the
reasons why we marked up global growth is because of an
anticipated fiscal stimulus in the United States, okay. Now
the Trump administration, the President has been very clear
about the broad directions of that, but the specifics will take
time and so we’ve done our best to make an estimate of that.
On our estimate of that fiscal stimulus, the market path
doesn’t fully offset that fiscal stimulus, so it’s net fiscal -
market path sorry for interest rates doesn’t fully offset, for US
interest rates doesn’t fully offset. So we take that into
account.
It then affects demand for UK exports; it affects the
pressures on inflation here, and ultimately feeds into the
policy determination. So that’s one example of how we would
take it into account, but in effect we take it as given and use
market judgements on that and optimise around it.
Jason Douglas,
Wall Street Journal: Could I just ask you to say a bit more on the global outlook
as well please, particularly around its fragility? We have, as
you mentioned, a US administration that’s talking on the one
hand about fiscal stimulus but also about more protectionist
measures. We also of course this year have pretty high
stakes elections in Europe. Given that the stronger growth
sort of underpins your forecast for the UK, how fragile do you
think it is and what are the consequences for the policy trade
off that you describe? Thank you.

Mark Carney: Are you okay, Jason? You've got a bit of a cold; okay just
want to make sure [laughs].
In terms of - well let’s take the first part of your question
because it slightly links with Harry's, which is that - for our
forecast, as I say, we have marked up global growth. And in
fact, if you dig into it, the bit of global growth that matters
most for the UK has been marked up more significantly than
global growth.
So just to give you broad numbers, I think it’s 2% - UK
weighted global growth grew at 2% last year and it’s about
2.4% by the end of this year and subsequent years. So
that’s a pretty - that’s significant and that’s part of the reason
why better world in our view for the forecast contributes
about more than a quarter of the increase in this forecast.
And importantly in that is US fiscal which I mentioned, but
also what has been an improvement in sentiment thus far in
the United States and a business sentiment, and also financial
conditions. So we’re taking some of that on board in our
forecast.
We do have a downside skew to our global growth forecasts
in year two and three, and they relate to some of the
fragilities you mention. So we’ve taken up the most likely
scenario but we see downside risk.
And not ascribing to any particular country or policy, but
there are risks around de-globalisation that exist in terms of
big changes to market access, whether it’s capital market
access or access for goods and services. And there are risks
around - there are risks in emerging markets; we have long
flagged some of the risks around China and domestic
developments there, and how they could spill over if things
didn’t go as well as hoped, how they could spill over globally. 
Page 24
Inflation Report Q&A - 2.2.17
And there is a bit of an intersection, as you can appreciate,
between some of those de-globalisation risks and the China
risk. So that’s how we’ve taken that aspect on board.
Jenny Scott: That’s about all we’ve got time for.
Mark Carney: Okay. So as some of you would know this is Minouche's last
press conference as Deputy Governor for Markets and
Banking and it’s noted in the Minutes, but just on behalf of
the Committee, the MPC and all colleagues at the Bank of
England, we want to thank Minouche for her service to the
Bank and to the people of the United Kingdom. I mean from
time on the MPC, but really for making what was a new
position, establishing it firmly and getting all the benefits
across markets, banking and international to make this a
more effective institution.
And I can highlight many things but compliment particularly
work that had a higher profile, which is a fair and effective
markets review which has catalysed a series of reforms here,
and in work which would have a lower profile, but is equally
important around how we’re managing risk management for
our balance sheet at the Bank, which as you many of you
know is pretty big, and the reforms to RTGS, which is the
large value payments system, which she's also received. So
on behalf of all of us - thank you, Minouche, and thank all of
you for your attention.
