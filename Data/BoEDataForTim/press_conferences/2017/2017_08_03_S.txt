INFLATION REPORT PRESS CONFERENCE
Thursday 3
rd August 2017
Opening Remarks by the Governor
Good afternoon.
The UK economy is beginning the process of adjusting to a new, as yet uncertain, economic
relationship with the European Union. Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real
incomes likely to accompany the move to new trading arrangements with the EU, but it can
influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises. And it can
support UK households and businesses as they adjust to such profound change.
The MPC has long emphasised that the effects on inflation of the Brexit process would be the
product of its impact on demand, supply and the exchange rate. And it has consistently
stressed that as a result, the implications for monetary policy would not be automatic.
The August Inflation Report, released today, updates on how these and other dynamics are
affecting the economic outlook.
Since the referendum was called, UK households, businesses and financial markets have
reacted at different speeds and to varying degrees to the prospects for the UK’s departure
from the EU.
- Financial markets, particularly sterling, marked down the UK’s relative prospects
quickly and sharply.
- Households looked through Brexit-related uncertainties initially. But more recently,
as the consequences of sterling’s fall have shown up in the shops and squeezed their
real incomes, they have cut back on spending, slowing the economy.

- Businesses have been somewhere in between. But since the referendum, they have
invested much less aggressively than usual in response to an otherwise very
favourable environment.
The MPC’s projections continue to be conditioned on a smooth transition to an average of
possible outcomes for the UK’s post-Brexit trading arrangements. To be clear, assuming a
smooth transition doesn’t mean that the MPC thinks UK households and businesses know the
end result of negotiations that have just started. Indeed, in the MPC forecast, uncertainty
about the eventual shape of the UK’s economic relationship with the EU weighs on the
decisions of businesses and households and pulls down on both demand and supply growth.
Rather, the assumption of a smooth Brexit means that UK households and businesses act on
the expectation that the UK will forge a new relationship with Europe without material
disruptions to trading conditions or financial stability. This simplifying assumption has
broadly fit the behaviour of the real economy over the past year.
GDP
In the MPC’s central projection, GDP growth remains sluggish in the near term as the
squeeze on households’ real incomes continues to weigh on consumption. Growth then picks
up to just above its reduced – or modest – potential rate as net trade and business investment
firm up and consumption growth gradually recovers in line with modestly rising household
incomes.
The outlook for net trade is bolstered by strong global growth and the past depreciation of
sterling. Global growth has firmed in line with the MPC’s expectations, and it is now broad
based across advanced and emerging economies. Global trade is growing at its strongest rate
since 2011. And there are encouraging signs that the composition of advanced economy

growth is rotating towards investment, supporting the sustainability of the expansion and
potentially raising the equilibrium rate of interest.
This strong external environment, businesses’ high rates of profitability, their low cost of
capital and the limited spare capacity in the economy are all expected to support investment
by UK firms over the forecast period. However, while on balance these incentives more than
offset the drag from the continued uncertainties around Brexit, business investment is still
likely to growth below historic average rates with adverse consequences for productivity,
capacity and wages.
CPI inflation
CPI inflation fell back to 2.6% in June, in line with the projection in May. The MPC expects
inflation to peak around 3% in October and to remain around 2¾% until early next year.
Conditional on the current market curve, which implies that Bank Rate will rise by ½
percentage point over the next three years, inflation is projected to remain a little above the
target at the end of the forecast period – an overshoot that reflects entirely the effects of the
referendum-related fall in sterling.
As the effect of rising import prices gradually diminishes, domestic inflationary pressures
gradually pick up over the forecast period. With the unemployment rate expected to remain
around 40-year lows, wage growth is projected to recover as the remaining slack in the
economy is absorbed. In addition, margins in the consumer sector, having been squeezed by
the pickup in import prices, are expected to be rebuilt. Consequently inflation is projected to
remain at a level slightly above the two percent target by the end of the forecast.

Policy decision
As the Brexit negotiations proceed, the assumption of a smooth transition to a new economic
relationship with the EU will be tested. If UK households and businesses look through the
flurry of headlines, then the economy can be expected to pick up from its current period of
sluggishness.
Given the outlook for supply in the economy, even a limited pickup in growth is likely to
have consequences for the stance of monetary policy.
That’s because, as the MPC has previously emphasised, the process of leaving the EU is
beginning to affect potential supply in the UK. Brexit-related uncertainties are causing some
companies to delay decisions about building capacity and entering new markets. The UK’s
eventual new trading arrangements will require a period of reallocation as some sectors of the
economy expand and others contract. Moreover, prolonged low investment will restrain
growth in the capital stock and increases in productivity. Indeed, if the MPC’s current
forecast comes to pass, the level of investment in 2020 is expected to be 20% below the level
which the MPC had projected just before the referendum.
As a result of these factors, the supply capacity of the economy is likely to expand at only
modest rates throughout the forecast period. That means that only a modest uptick in demand
growth from current sluggish rates will be sufficient to reduce and eventually eliminate slack.
The MPC’s remit specifies that, in exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance
any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target
and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity.

Through most of the forecast period, the economy operates with a small degree of spare
capacity and CPI inflation is well above target. But by the end of the forecast, that trade-off
is eliminated, spare capacity is fully absorbed, and inflation remains above the 2% target.
The Committee judges that, given the assumptions underlying its projections, including the
closure of drawdown period of the TFS and the recent prudential decisions of the FPC and
PRA, some tightening of monetary policy would be required in order to achieve a sustainable
return of inflation to target.
Specifically, if the economy follows a path broadly consistent with the August central
projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent
over the forecast period than the path implied by the yield curve underlying those projections.
Any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.
The Committee will continue to monitor closely the incoming evidence, and it stands ready to
respond to changes in the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of
inflation to the 2% target.
