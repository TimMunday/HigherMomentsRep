Inflation Report Press Conference
Thursday 4th August 2016
Opening Remarks by the Governor
Good afternoon.
The decision to leave the European Union marks a regime change. In the coming
years, the UK will redefine its openness to the movement of goods, services, people
and capital.
Some of the adjustments to this new reality may prove difficult and many will take
time. But the UK can handle change. It has one of the most flexible economies in the
world. It benefits from a deep reservoir of human capital, world-class infrastructure
and the rule of law. Its people are admired the world over for their strength under
adversity.
To be clear, the future potential of this economy and its implications for jobs, real
wages and wealth are not the gifts of monetary policymakers. We cannot immediately
or fully offset the economic impacts of a large structural shock.
However, monetary policy can support the necessary adjustments of the UK economy
during a period of heightened uncertainty.
That’s why, at its meeting yesterday, the MPC agreed an exceptional package of
measures comprising:
 a 25 basis point reduction in Bank Rate to 0.25%;
 a new Term Funding Scheme (TFS) to reinforce the pass-through of the cut in
Bank Rate to the borrowing rates actually faced by households and firms;
 a new programme of private sector asset purchases with up to £10 billion of
UK corporate bonds; and
 a £60 billion expansion of gilt purchases.

Economic outlook
We took these steps because the economic outlook has changed markedly, with the
largest revision to our GDP forecast since the MPC was formed almost two decades
ago.
Early indicators are consistent with the risks the MPC identified before the vote. And
we now face a trade-off between the degree of support we give to the economy on the
one hand and how fast we return inflation sustainably to the target on the other.
By acting early and comprehensively, the MPC can reduce uncertainty, bolster
confidence, blunt the slowdown, and support the necessary adjustments in the UK
economy.
The degree and composition of stimulus is largely determined by the effects of the
vote to leave the EU on demand, supply and the exchange rate.
Demand
Beginning with demand, the 9% depreciation of sterling since the referendum will
boost exports and weigh on imports. However, even though the MPC expects the
current account deficit to halve over the next three years, improvements in the
external sector are not expected to offset fully the drag from substantially weaker
private domestic demand.
The MPC expects several factors to weigh on investment in the near term and on
employment and consumer spending over time. These include a protracted period of
heightened uncertainty, weaker activity in residential and commercial real estate
markets, and a higher cost of capital for UK-focused firms.
Some of these effects are beginning to manifest in surveys of investment intentions,
business activity, and the housing market. These indicators have fallen sharply, in
most cases to levels last seen in the wake of the financial crisis, and in some cases to
all-time lows.
The MPC has been conservative in its interpretation of these data, producing a
forecast that is stronger than historical relationships would imply. Nonetheless, we 
3
expect aggregate demand to grow only a little for the next few quarters before picking
up to rates that remain below those projected in May.
Supply
The extent to which this lower path for aggregate demand is likely to be accompanied
by a lower path for aggregate supply is a key determinant of the inflation outlook.
The weakness in demand will itself weigh on supply as a period of low investment
restrains growth in the capital stock and productivity.
There could also be more direct implications for supply from the decision to leave the
European Union. The UK’s trading relationships are likely to change, but precisely
how will be unclear for some time. If companies are uncertain about the future
impact of this on their businesses, they could delay decisions about building supply
capacity or entering new markets. In addition, in anticipation of the UK’s new trading
arrangements, a period of resource reallocation could be necessary as some sectors of
the economy expand and others contract.
As a result of these factors, the MPC expects supply growth to remain well below past
average rates throughout the forecast period.
The combination of these demand and supply factors means that cumulative GDP
growth is expected to be around 2½% lower by the end of the forecast period than
was the case in May. On balance, even after stimulus, a margin of spare capacity is
expected to open up and the unemployment rate expected to rise from its current level
of 4.9% to around 5½% over the next two years.
Exchange rate
The fall in sterling will push up on import and consumer prices notably over the next
three years. Indeed, despite the much weaker outlook for activity, CPI inflation in
two years’ time is projected to be higher than expected in May, reaching 2.4% at both
the two and three year points of our forecast.

Policy trade-off
The MPC’s Remit recognises that when the effects of shocks persist over an extended
period, the MPC is likely to face an exceptional trade-off between returning inflation
to target promptly and stabilising output.
When this is the case, the Remit requires the MPC to explain how it has balanced that
trade-off, including the horizon over which it aims to return inflation to target.
Fully offsetting the persistent effects of sterling’s depreciation on inflation would
require exerting further downward pressure on domestic costs. And that would mean
even more lost output and a total disregard for higher unemployment.
In the Committee’s judgement, such outcomes would be undesirable in themselves
and, moreover, would be unlikely to generate a sustainable return of inflation to the
target beyond its three-year forecast period.
As a result, in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of the shock on growth,
the MPC is setting policy so that inflation settles at its target over a longer period than
the usual 18-24 months.
Policy response
To achieve this balance, the MPC is today implementing a timely, coherent and
comprehensive package of measures.
First, the response is timely because the combination of the markedly weaker outlook
for the economy and the lags in the transmission of monetary policy dictates the need
for stimulus now. For example, cutting Bank Rate will immediately ease financing
conditions for households and firms, thereby supporting activity. Around half of
mortgagors have floating rate contracts and more than four-fifths of bank loans held
by firms are at floating rates; lower interest rates will be felt immediately in the
economy.
Second, the package of measures is coherent.
The MPC recognises the risk that, when interest rates are very low, Bank Rate cuts
might not be fully passed on to the interest rates actually faced by households and 
5
firms. There have been examples overseas of interest rates on loans increasing when
official policy rates have been reduced from very low levels.
The MPC is determined that the stimulus the economy needs does not get diluted as it
passes through the financial system.
That’s why it has launched a new Term Funding Scheme. The TFS will reinforce the
transmission of cuts in Bank Rate to the interest rates actually faced by households
and firms.
Compared to the old Funding for Lending Scheme, the TFS is a pure monetary policy
instrument that is likely to be more stimulative pound-for-pound. Specifically, it
 reinforces Bank Rate cuts,
 reduces the effective lower bound of Bank Rate to close to but a little above
zero,
 charges a penalty rate if banks don’t lend,
 covers all types of lending, and
 is funded by central bank reserves.
UK banks and building societies could borrow up to £100 billion over the next year at
rates that neutralise the effects that could otherwise cause them not to pass on the new
lower Bank Rate to end borrowers.
The coherence of today’s stimulus package is further enhanced by:
 The FPC’s decision today to amend the leverage ratio framework for UK
banks by excluding central bank reserves. This gets a regulatory constraint out
of the way of monetary policy operations without compromising financial
stability;
 The FPC’s earlier action to increase the availability of credit by up to £150
billion by cutting the counter-cyclical capital buffer rate to zero and
emphasising that banks’ liquidity reserves are usable; and 
6
 The PRA Board’s decision to use regulatory flexibilities to smooth insurers’
transition to new regulatory standards in a very low interest rate environment.
Third, the package is comprehensive. The cut in Bank Rate, the new Term Funding
Scheme, the new corporate bond purchases and the expansion of gilt purchases work
through multiple channels, are mutually reinforcing, and more powerful as a result.
In the absence of these actions, output would have been lower, unemployment higher,
and slack greater over the forecast period, and the return of inflation to the target
would have been less sustainable.
The purchase of up to £10 billion of UK corporate bonds will support the real
economy by directly affecting financing conditions for companies that make a
material contribution to UK economic activity. By supporting investment, this action
should improve the monetary policy trade-off with inflation. By acting in capital
markets, it will be complementary to the TFS which reinforces the bank lending
channel. And by lowering credit and liquidity premia, corporate bond purchases are
an efficient means of providing stimulus.
Expanding the stock of gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility by £60 billion will
reinforce the transmission of lower Bank Rate to longer-term market interest rates. In
addition, by triggering a process of portfolio rebalancing among sellers of long-dated
gilts, gilt purchases will transmit to other risky asset prices, easing financial
conditions and providing additional stimulus directly.
Conclusion
The MPC has worked closely with the Bank’s other committees to understand how
conventional and unconventional monetary measures interact with the financial
system. We have tailored our approach to avoid unintended consequences. This
joined-up approach, using multiple channels, will ensure that stimulus will have
maximum impact on the real economy.
By acting now, the MPC is supporting the necessary adjustments in the UK economy
and ensuring a more sustainable return of inflation to the target in the medium term.

This is a timely, coherent and comprehensive package of measures. It is appropriately
sized given the scale of the shock, uncertainties about the degree of the adjustment,
and relatively limited data.
All of the elements in this package have scope to be increased. The MPC can lower
Bank Rate, increase the size of the TFS, and expand the scale or variety of assets held
in the Asset Purchase Facility.
Indeed, if the incoming data prove broadly consistent with the August Inflation
Report forecast, a majority of MPC members would anticipate a further cut in Bank
Rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC’s forthcoming meetings during
the course of this year.
Today’s announcement is the latest element of the Bank’s joined-up policy response
to the referendum.
A plan that was based on months of extensive analysis of the risks, detailed planning
and appropriate public communication before the vote.
A plan that delivered a broad range of contingency measures to contain the immediate
impact on the financial system of the result.
A plan that has already expanded the amount of credit available to the economy.
And now a plan that delivers a timely, coherent and comprehensive monetary policy
response that lowers the cost of credit and improves financial conditions for
households and businesses across a wide range of channels.
The Bank continues to stand ready to take whatever action is needed to achieve its
objectives for monetary and financial stability as the UK adjusts to new realities, and
moves forward to seize new opportunities, outside the EU.
