Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
Emily Cadman, Financial Times: Governor, you've been clear that monetary policy can only
mitigate, but not cushion entirely, the shock of Brexit. Is
there anything the government can and should do?
Mark Carney: Well, the first thing, Emily, is that obviously we can act
quickly. And I think the Bank has acted quickly across from
contingency planning the actions of the FPC and now the
actions of the MPC. So monetary policy is more nimble, and
it's appropriate that it's the first responder to a shock.
Clearly, the biggest elements of the change are structural,
and monetary policy has to take those structural changes into
account in setting policy, but it can't really do anything about
those structural factors. So the biggest issues for the
government are those that they've acknowledged, which is
the importance of the negotiations with European allies on
the new relationship that will be developed; the importance of
having a productivity plan, a comprehensive productivity
plan, for the country. And it's within that context or it's those
decisions and those policies which will really be the
determinants of the long term prosperity.
What we need to do in that context and in advance of those
decisions is to provide the appropriate stance of monetary
policy to ease the adjustment. We're governed by our remit,
and in that remit we are governed by a trade-off and setting
the right trade-off between getting inflation back sustainably
to target and supporting output.
And we I think have pretty clearly outlined in the Report and
with this decision how we see that trade-off and where we
can provide support. Thank you.
Ed Conway, Sky News: Governor, you in the Inflation Report do not see the UK
having a recession. Is that as a result of the action the Bank
has taken? Were it not for what the Bank has decided today, 
Page 3
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
would the UK have faced that recession a lot of people were
concerned about in the run up to Brexit?
Mark Carney: Yes. Well, I think the first is to re-emphasise how you started
the question, which is our central forecast is for a relatively
modest period of growth initially, second half of this year.
We described it as - there will be little growth in the second
half, but positive, positive growth in the second half. That's
our central expectation. And then that growth would pick up
over the forecast horizon, aided by monetary policy
importantly, as the transmission starts to come through.
Growth would pick up, but to levels below that expected in
May. So that's our central expectation.
If we hadn't taken the steps we took today, we do expect
output would have been lower; unemployment would have
been higher. And we would have achieved a poor balance in
terms of returning inflation sustainably to target and
foregoing output.
Now with all forecasts there are risks on either side. It's
possible that growth could be a little stronger; it's possible
that growth could be a little weaker. We have in the actions
that we've taken today, by acting through multiple channels
with a coherent policy package, we have improved the
economic outcomes for this country. There will be less
unemployment, there will be more activity and there'll be a
greater prospect of a successful adjustment to the new
realities that the UK faces.
Kamal Ahmed, BBC News: Governor, given that the supply of finance possibly isn't the
most serious issue facing the UK economy, how can you be
sure that any of the measures that you have announced
today will work and are not just simply very marginal
attempts at mitigating some of the effects of Brexit?
Page 4
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
And also just wondered - what's your message to savers, who
must be looking at the announcements today and thinking -
there is no point in me saving money for the future?
Mark Carney: Well the first thing is that we're living through a time of
considerable uncertainty, and one thing we can do is reduce
the uncertainties over the issues we have control. We have
tremendous influence over the supply of finance, the price of
finance, in this economy. So the actions of the FPC a few
weeks ago on the countercyclical buffer that built on years of
building up the capital position of the banks have been
absolutely reinforced by the actions of the MPC today, to
improve the price of credit, overall financial conditions.
And I want to stress this point, which is that the MPC didn't
just pick certain stimulus measures. It sat down, it thought
through, had very detailed analysis, extensive conversations
with the FPC, with the PRA board, to think through how
various stimulus options would interact with not just the
banks but the financial system as a whole, and designed the
programme in order to determine that we would get the
maximum amount of stimulus to households and businesses.
That's why the TFS exists.
And I will say as an aside, but it's an important aside, it's an
example of the tremendous advantage of the structure of the
Bank of England that we are also the supervisors of these
banks and building societies, and we can really get under the
hood and understand how they will react to certain policies.
So being clear about, with businesses and households,
anyone watching, if you have a viable business idea, if you
qualify for a mortgage, you should be able to get access to
credit. This is not 2008/9/10/11/12/13 and half of 14.
Okay? It's a different world. But that's enough in people's
memories that it's important to take that off the table.
Page 5
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
Secondly, the stimulus measures we're taking are going to
flow through. They’re designed to flow through and we've
thought it through in terms of how - and we'll be watching
that they flow through. That has an effect. As with all
monetary policy measures, it's an effect that builds over time.
There's an immediate cash flow effect that people see, but it
will build over time and have an impact over the forecast. So
we can control no more and we're not going to ignore or step
aside on those issues when it's our responsibility.
With respect to savers, let me first say - this is something
that we think about a lot. There's a group of people who
have worked hard, absolutely done the right thing, set money
aside, and the returns are very low and are likely to be low
for some time. That's true in the UK, it's true in all advanced
economies. And the challenge is to get the economy in a
position so it can grow sustainably at a higher rate.
Those decisions will be determined not by the Monetary Policy
Committee, but to go to Emily's question earlier, those are
the big structural decisions that will be made by
governments.
We can support that adjustment, and we will. And we will
ensure for savers, for pension funds, for insurance
companies, for other pools of capital that ultimately are only
there for the benefit of UK citizens, but for all those entities,
that there will be a better economic outcome; that the
economy will grow more; that there will be fewer
unemployed; and that ultimately we'll adjust to this new
equilibrium faster and in a better way. And that's our
contribution.
Noreena Hertz, ITV News: Governor, last week NatWest and RBS talked about their
concerns about negative interest rates. This is something
that you yourself have expressed many concerns about in the
past. Can we now definitively rule out the possibility of 
Page 6
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
negative interest rates? Because I note that in the Report
you say that you are currently bound to the lowest level of
interest rates being just above zero. But I noted the use of
the word currently.
Mark Carney: Yeah. Thank you for the question. Look, as you might have
gathered and you said in your question, I'm not a fan of
negative interest rates. We see the negative consequences of
them through the financial system; we've seen that in other
jurisdictions. We've seen the issues with savers, it goes even
further than the issues that were just raised with Kamal. We
have other options to provide stimulus if more stimulus were
needed, so we don't need to go to that resort. I think the
MPC is very clear that we see the effective lower bound as a
positive number, close to zero, but a positive number. And
we will continue to be clear in our expectations on that.
Let me say this about the banks. The banks have no excuse,
with today's announcement, not to pass on this cut in Bank
Rate. And they should write to their customers and make
that point.
Phil Aldrick, The Times: Governor, I'll pick you up on that last point then - the banks
have no excuse not to pass this on. It looks like potentially a
£750m bung that you're giving to the banks through the term
lending scheme. This is through reducing their funding costs
against that 1% which you said is the average norm at the
moment. Is it possible that you should - or are you
considering wrapping this with a condition around bonuses,
with any conditions around dividends, to make sure that
there is a responsible approach here?
Mark Carney: Well, I'll say a couple of things. There's two sides to this.
One is that what we have seen elsewhere, and what we see
here as their supervisor, is the squeeze that starts to come in
on bank margins that then affects the price they charge on
marginal loans - this is really about the new loans that they're 
Page 7
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
making, the price they charge on new loans - that happens
when interest rates get very low, very close to zero.
So we've seen this movie, we've seen it elsewhere. We've
seen the sequels elsewhere. We've been monitoring this for a
number of years. We have very carefully calibrated the
pricing and the sizing of the TFS to neutralise this effect so
that in aggregate there is no reward for the banks and there's
no penalties for the banks. What there is is a facility that
ensures that they can fully pass through the cut in Bank Rate
to their customers.
And by the way, it's a facility that also means that we have
some limited, but additional flexibility to lower Bank Rate if
that's required to support the economy - again in a way that
that further reduction would be passed through.
So it's offsetting a squeeze that could be there, and it's an
advantage of the structure of this institution, candidly, and
the MPC listening to other parts of the institution - asking the
questions and then listening to other parts of the institution -
in that we're able to understand these dynamics and design a
facility that does that.
There are penalty rates if banks reduce lending, but I would
stress this is really about - and your question is about - the
transmission of those Bank Rate cuts to the real economy, as
opposed to a scheme to incentivise certain amounts of
lending. That was the old FLS; this is designed for a different
purpose.
Larry Elliott, The Guardian: In his letter to you today, the Chancellor said he was
prepared to take any necessary steps himself to boost the
economy over the coming months. If he was to issue
infrastructure bonds at public investment, would you have
any objection to using the asset purchase facility to buy those
bonds?
Page 8
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
Mark Carney: Well, the first thing I'll say is that, as you'd expect, since the
Chancellor was appointed, he and I have met a number of
times to discuss the economic situation, to discuss policy
options. As you would expect, as you know, the Chancellor
himself - or whoever the Chancellor is - he or she is - knows
the broad outlines of an MPC decision prior to that decision,
and of course in the case of this decision, where there's an
indemnity being given for the asset purchase facility, we had
extensive discussions of the possible decisions of the MPC.
So we're fully aligned in terms of, he's fully informed in terms
of the MPC's thinking and the broader Bank's thinking about
what we can do to support this adjustment process. As you
rightly know, he has been clear that he's willing to take any
necessary steps to support the economy and reduce
uncertainty. Those are the decisions for him and for the
government, and they operate on a different timeframe.
With respect to - and we're not privy to those decisions, and
as you can see in the forecast we make no assumption about
any change in the stance of fiscal policy, for example - in the
forecast, as per convention, as we always do.
We think - the MPC thinks this is the right package for today,
so it's not appropriate for me to commit that we would
countenance doing something else beyond what we have
said. And the one thing we have said is that for a majority of
members of the MPC, if the data over the course of this year
comes in broadly consistent with the forecast in this Inflation
Report, they would expect to move Bank Rate to that
effective lower bound, just above zero.
Andy Bell, Five News: Governor, just to go back to the source of all this, drawing on
all your experience, just how extraordinary was the problem
with which you were presented by the Brexit vote?
Page 9
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
Mark Carney: Well it's an unusual situation in the sense of it is a very large
identifiable supply shock. You know, the biggest news on the
horizon is there will be an adjustment to the supply potential
of the economy. I would distinguish that there is an
adjustment with the changed relationship with the EU and
then there's an adjustment which may happen at the same
time, or maybe slightly after, with expanded relationships
with the rest of the world. So we have to think about that
supply shock and how that affects the economy today. That's
a relatively unusual situation.
What isn't necessarily unusual is to be in a position where
there is a trade-off between supporting activity and the time
horizon over which a Monetary Policy Committee returns
inflation to target. And one of the advantages of this system
- I speak having been operating in another system - one of
the advantages of the system here is that we have to be very
upfront and transparent about how we've thought about that,
which disciplines the Committee. And we come out and are
clear over what horizon we're going to bring inflation back
and how we're going to support the economy.
So unusual is the supply shock, the trade-off isn't that
unusual. The third aspect, which is somewhat unusual or
exceptional, to use the language I've used today, is the fact
that, given interest rates are relatively low and given what we
now know about the interaction of conventional and
unconventional policy with the financial system, it has been
relatively unusual, or it has required some creativity, or
innovation in terms of the design of the package in order to
get the right amount of stimulus in a way that will really
affect underlying financial conditions.
David Smith, Sunday Times: Governor, one of the responses you may get to this from
people who supported Brexit and maybe even from some
former MPC members, is that this was an overreaction, or is
an overreaction based on fairly limited evidence, and that it 
Page 10
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
could even undermine, rather than boost confidence, because
of the scale of the Bank's actions. How do you respond to
that?
Mark Carney: Well, look, this is the appropriate response to the economic
conditions in which we find ourselves. This is a response
which will make this process of negotiation, transition,
ultimately Brexit - it's going to support it, it's going to make it
more likely to be a success, not just in the longer term, but in
the nearer term, it's going to help with adjustment.
There is a great degree of uncertainty, it's entirely
understandable that there is, there's uncertainty about the
eventual model that we will have with the European Union,
there are a number of options on the table. Whichever model
is chosen itself will require some degree of adjustment in the
economy and that brings its own effects on growth and
productivity for a period of time.
We are seeing - and I'm going to ask Ben Broadbent to
expand on this - we are seeing these risks manifest in a wide
variety of indicators, indicators which actually in many cases
are better indicators of what's actually happening in the
economy than hard data, so-called hard data. And there is a
clear case for stimulus and stimulus now in order to be there
when the economy really needs it, to have an effect when the
economy really needs it.
So this is about cushioning the shock, supporting the
adjustment, taking uncertainty off the table and ultimately
making this a success. But I might ask Ben to speak a bit to
some of the data, to go into it.
Ben Broadbent: Perhaps I can say to start with that there are sort of, in the
information we get, degrees of hardness if you like. Even the
early official estimates of GDP I wouldn't describe as totally
hard, in the sense that they get revised for many years 
Page 11
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
afterwards. And many of these surveys continue to have
information about what that final estimate of GDP will be
many years from now, even after the ONS has started
publishing its own earlier estimates.
If you look at the chart on page 22, the top of that page, this
is one of the more reliable indicators of activity, the CIP
Surveys. We've weighted the sectors here into one single
series, or rather two - one for output, one for expectations.
These are the steepest falls in both those series we've ever
had, and they are both of them at levels we haven’t seen
since early 2009.
They are reliable indicators, these and a few other surveys.
And I would point out that if you took them at face value they
would suggest the economy is actually contracting. Now
we've aimed off that, and we've aimed off it precisely because
on occasion, even for these surveys, big shocks can lead to
over reactions of things like this, and in particular the other
confidence indictors. But we would need them to recover in
coming months to meet the forecast we have, which is for a
little bit of growth during the second half of the year.
So I don't think it's premature to have acted in the face of
weakening in these output surveys, weakening employment
surveys, steep falls in some of the investment intentions
against a backdrop in which investment was already falling,
and also pretty steep falls in indicators of housing market
activity.
Louise Cooper, Freelance: I was on Radio 2 yesterday and a saver, a lady - doing a
question and answer session actually for ordinary people,
what this meant for them. And a lady, I think she was called
Lucy called in and she said - I've got six grand of savings,
what do I do with them? What are your models assume she
does with them? Do you assume that savers spend their
money? Do you assume they're forced into riskier assets? 
Page 12
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
What do you want them to do with their savings, which if
your inflation forecasts are right, are earning substantially
less than inflation over the coming years and their purchasing
power is going down?
Mark Carney: Well, the first thing is our models and the way we look at the
economy is we look at it in aggregate, because that's our
responsibility is to target aggregates, aggregate level of
inflation; keep it low, stable, predicable, that 2%. That's the
core of our responsibility. But in doing that, to do it in a way
that minimises impacts on output - how much activity in the
economy - and employment.
And we're faced right now with a forecast after a substantial
stimulus package where the unemployment rate goes from
4.9 to 5.5%, that's more than a quarter of a million people
losing their job, after stimulus. Okay. Should we ignore
that? Should we have more - I'll get to the point, but should
we have more people lose their job in order to target a
different part of the economy? Should we have a poorer
outcome for the economy at a time when there's great
uncertainty? Should we change the way we manage our
responsibilities to aim off what we are statutorily obligated to
do, which is to manage this trade off to achieve the inflation
target over the medium term?
That’s not the judgement of the MPC, every single member of
the MPC's view was that this economy needed stimulus now.
Different views on different degrees of stimulus and
packages, but everyone viewed that it needed stimulus now.
I fully recognise - we fully recognise - that a long period of
low interest rates puts savers in a very difficult position. And
fully recognise that there is a difference between individual
savers and institutional savers, the pension funds, the UCITS,
the insurance companies. 
Page 13
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
We do expect those aggregates - and what we do see for
those bigger institutional savers are the moves into riskier
assets, longer dated government debt, into corporate debt if
they had government debt, into equities if they had corporate
debt, from equities into hard assets if they had equities and
on and on. And that supports the economy, that makes it
less likely that we will have a very long period of high
unemployment, low output, and very low interest rates. So
we recognise the challenge, ultimately this lessens the
challenge for the economy as a whole.
I'll say one last thing, which is that, when you step back, as
we must, and look at the global economy as a whole and
what's happening to interest rates in the global economy as a
whole, there are a variety of forces. Some of it's the legacy
still of the financial crisis; some of it is broader demographic
forces; some of it's the rise of China and other economies - a
variety of factors which are all pushing down on global
interest rates globally. And we're faced with the choice that
as that - and I'm sorry to use jargon - but as the equilibrium
interest rate goes down, and in fact in many jurisdictions
goes negative, we're faced with a choice of either ignoring it
and then running monetary policy too tight and unnecessarily
contracting the economy - unnecessarily, missing our
mandate - or adjusting with as smart stimulus as possible,
that is as effective as possible, goes through multiple
channels, which doesn't just go through the channel that
directly affects the saver, but goes through multiple channels
which doesn't lead to negative interest rates, to go to
Noreena's question, in a way that can support growth. And
that's the judgement that we have made today.
Hugo Duncan, Daily Mail: Thank you. Governor, I note that you discussed cutting rates
immediately to the effect of lower bound and the majority
thought that that could be done now. You didn't in the end;
is that because you wanted a unanimous decision on rates? I
note that the decision to buy government gilts was not 
Page 14
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
unanimous because there were concerns among three
members that recent surveys overstate the weakness of the
economy. Were you trying to give a unified decision on
interest rates at least, hence the reason why there was just
the quarter point cut?
Mark Carney: Well, there are two reasons. The first is that we were able to
provide the stimulus in other ways. And we saw value in
having a package of measures, as opposed to relying on one
measure alone. Why is that the case? First, it goes through
multiple channels, Bank Rate at the short end, gilt purchases
long end, corporate bonds through a new channel and then
the TFS, making sure those Bank Rate cuts get across.
So multiple channels, complementary, mutually reinforcing,
stronger as a result. And by the way all of this backed up by
some other technical decisions of the FPC around the leverage
ratio and countercyclical capital buffer, important technical
decisions.
So value in having a package, and also the reality that we will
have another meeting in September, another one in October,
another on in the December, and we will get more data. And
as we said, if the data is broadly consistent with the forecast,
the majority of members would expect to act during the
course of this year.
I would stress that on all elements of this package we have
scope to add if that were necessary. And we would do so, but
only to the extent that it's consistent with our remit. So it is
a very much contingent on how the forecast evolves.
Harry Daniels,
Live Squawk News: Listening to your response about other central banks and the
actions they've taken, having looked at other central bank
decisions, did that affect the MPC's decision to deliver a
bigger package now, as opposed to wait and see where the 
Page 15
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
data went? And also, is there a yield limit at which
government and corporate bond buying will be capped as in
the ECB and the way they work their bond buying scheme?
Mark Carney: Well, the answer to the second is no. And the answer to the
first effectively is no as well. You know, we're influenced by
conditions here. This is a package which targets the domestic
economy, that's where the big adjustments are going to take
place. We've already had a notable exchange rate
adjustment which will help the external sector; we do see the
external sector as importantly contributing to growth. We do
see the current account deficit likely halving over the course
of the forecast horizon. But it's the domestic economy which
likely will need some support from monetary policy. And
that's why we designed the package as we did.
Szu Chan, The Telegraph: Just a follow up question on the Term Funding Scheme. On
the one hand you say this scheme was specifically designed
to help banks with their net interest margins to ensure that
all the benefits are passed onto households and businesses
and there should be no excuses. On the other hand, we've
already seen lenders increase their tracker margins on
mortgages. So what conversations or reassurances, if any,
have you had from the big lenders that the benefits will be
passed on to borrowers as well as the potential costs to
savers?
Mark Carney: Well one of the things - I mean Szu, we did not discuss any
monetary policy measures we were considering taking with
anyone in the financial system in advance, as you would
expect.
Szu Chan, The Telegraph: But they were concerned, and they voiced it you know
through the media about the potential impact?
Mark Carney: Look the concerned voice, as I interpreted it, was concerned
about negative interest rates, and we’re not intending to 
Page 16
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
move to negative interest rates - at least well, I'm not
intending to move to negative interest rates.
There are legitimate concerns about this compression. We’ve
seen it in other jurisdictions; we understand the dynamics of
it. Effectively think - I mean you understand the point, but
it’s hard to see deposit rates and one wouldn’t want to see
deposit rates go below zero. So there is value to having
some offset, and we have very good line of sight into what
that offset should be and that’s how we’ve designed it.
I’ll say one thing, which is there are some legacy mortgage
products that existed prior to the crisis and are still around
that were mispriced. You know, some people have very good
mortgages and they should hang onto them. And I can
understand why some financial institutions are no longer
providing - or have made adjustments to the pricing of those
products which were mispriced and consumers rightly took
advantage of that. So we’re not talking about that, but we’re
talking about making sure that this comes forward.
And look, be clear. We expect that that is what’s going to
happen. The economic incentive is going to be there; the
competition is going to be there. If you’re shopping around
and you’re not getting keen pricing, go to another bank or
building society. And you should because they all have
access to this facility.
Ben Chu, The Independent: Governor during the referendum campaign you warned that a
technical recession was a possibility as a result of a Brexit
vote. Your pro-Brexit critics said that was inappropriate
because they said it assumed no countervailing stimulus from
the Bank of England. Now today's forecast they don’t have a
recession forecast in them, but the strong implication is that’s
because you have stimulated. So the question is - do these
forecasts vindicate you or them?
Page 17
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
Mark Carney: Well, Ben you’re a sophisticated reader, as everyone is here
obviously, but a sophisticated reader of inflation reports. And
you know that on the GDP forecast we have a fan chart which
there are probabilities around. I am quoting you the central
expectation - the most likely outcome we expect - a little
growth in the second half of this year, gradually picking up to
relatively low rates over the forecast horizon, a cumulative
2.5% reduction in the overall level of GDP relative to what we
thought in May. Now that growth could be a little higher or it
could be a little lower, I’ll let you get out the ruler and figure
out the probability that it goes below zero.
And that’s a forecast with stimulus and so you can - if you
can follow the logic, you can make your own conclusion.
William James, Reuters: You talked about monitoring the flow through of this stimulus,
you mentioned it several times. I wonder if you could give us
more details of exactly how you will monitor that, what
criteria you will use and what levels would be acceptable?
Mark Carney: Yeah well we look at overall - I mean, we supervise the banks
themselves, and banks and building societies on an individual
basis. We have virtually, if we want, real time knowledge of
where their net interest margins are going, where their
profitability is going. And we’re able to assess that both on
an institutional - but what we’re really interested is on an
economy wide basis, so the sector as a whole. So we’ll be
watching that.
Now the net interest margins of the banks will be affected by
a few factors. One is the pricing of this and the existence of
this facility. The other is actually the economic implications
of the package as a whole for the performance of the
economy, the degree of impairments of loans which flow
through. So we will look at that. 
Page 18
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
We’re not going to act as a shadow FCA on this. We’ll look at
the aggregate effects, the economics are there. It’s there for
a reason, it’s there because there is an issue. To be
absolutely clear it’s there because there is an issue; the
banks aren’t making this up. But it’s priced in a way that
neutralises it so that it can be passed on, and we do have
competition in the banking building society sector and we
would expect to see that move forward.
Geoff Cutmore, CNBC: Governor, there's clearly been a reaction in sterling today to
the announcement, but given the announcement as it stands
and the package of measures you've taken, the Bank is quite
relaxed about the inflationary implications of that decline in
the pound that’s happened so far. But can I ask you - is
there a size of decline or a proportion of decline in future for
sterling that would raise alarm bells for you? Or perhaps a
type of market behaviour that the pound is experiencing that
would raise concerns?
Mark Carney: Well, you know, we’re an inflation targeter, not an exchange
rate targeter, so having a flexible exchange rate is an
important element of the monetary policy framework, it’s an
important element of the overall policy framework in this
country. It’s served the country well and it helps with
adjustment. But the stimulus that we've designed has been
targeted not at the exchange rate but at the domestic
economy in order to support the domestic economy. And we
would expect to see it flow mainly through that. That’s the
first point.
The second point is we have spent a lot of time analysing and
thinking through the pass through of changes in sterling to
the inflation rate and what we have seen, and what we have
learned since the financial crisis, has been that that pass
through tends to be protracted; it takes place over a number
of years. And in fact it’s that which creates the sharpest bit
of the trade off over the forecast horizon, the reason inflation 
Page 19
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
is at 2.4%, not below 2% in year three is entirely in our view
because of the pass through of past depreciation of sterling.
So we’re making a judgement about looking through that so
that we’re sustainably returning to target.
Now there's a limit to which we would do that. We didn’t
reach - obviously we calibrated this package appropriately in
the judgement of the MPC to balance that trade off, but it
shows that there are - the existence of that shows that there
are limits to where we would go in providing additional
stimulus domestically.
Geoff Cutmore, CNBC: Is that a 10% decline from here or …?
Mark Carney: That sounds like a follow up question.
Facilitator: We have loads more who haven’t asked a question yet I'm
afraid.
Catherine Boyle, CNBC: So you've mentioned in the Report a potential decline in
house prices over next year. Can you quantify that any
further for us and will there start to be any scenario where
you could see yourself starting to have conversations about
negative rates ever?
Ben Broadbent: Could you repeat that last bit?
Catherine Boyle, CNBC: I was just wondering if there was a scenario where you could
ever see yourself starting to have the negative interest rates
conversation?
Mark Carney: No on the negative interest rate conversation. I don’t see a
scenario for that. I think I've been about as clear as I can be
on that. If anyone - just write in whatever you want to take
that off the table for me, okay. I'm not trying to be clever in
the way I'm answering that question.

But on house prices, Ben?
Ben Broadbent: On house prices we have a, in the central forecast and if
there were fans around this and we published a chart, it
would probably be at least as wide as any other fan we have.
I think we predict in that central forecast a small decline in
house prices over the next year and then they start to pick up
again in line with average incomes after that.
Richard Barley,
Wall Street Journal: Governor, if we’re at the point where interest rates - a move
lowering the interest rates has to be offset for the banking
system by the term funding and some of the tweaks to
regulatory measures, what are the implications for the wider
financial system, particularly of very persistent low rates?
You talk about this move into riskier assets. We’ve already
had seven years of people moving into riskier assets. Where
does this go from here and what are the wider financial
implications for stability?
Mark Carney: Look I’ll step out of the MPC role for a second and speak as a
member of the FPC; all of us are. We basically approach
financial stability from a perspective of - we’re in a low for
long world for a long time, because when you think about
downside risks that’s the downside risk. So the stress tests
that we favour are those which are bear flattening type of
curves. We look at the implications of very low interest rates
for the insurance companies and how that flows back through
for the pension sector, for other asset classes and how they
manage that.
At this stage we understand these risks; we don’t see these
risks, these costs - we see these risks and costs as being
absolutely dominated by the benefits of providing the
stimulus, first point.

The second is, to go back to something I said earlier, which
we’ve stressed a number of times at these press conferences,
is the reason we have low interest rates is not because
central banks are choosing to have low interest rates. There
are much bigger forces which are driving this, and so the
question is whether we’re blind to that and therefore we don’t
provide the right amount of stimulus for the underlying
economy, or we take it into account.
It does make our job harder as a whole because we do have
to absolutely worry about these channels; we do have to take
adjustments. That’s part of the reason why you see such an
active FPC and an active international regulatory agenda of
which this institution is very much a part of.
Scott Hamilton, Bloomberg News: Since the Brexit vote we’ve seen a lot of turmoil on the other
side of London, a lot of political turmoil. Would you like to
take this opportunity to reassure investors in markets about
your commitment to seeing the UK economy through this
choppy waters and does that mean staying on toward 2021?
Mark Carney: Didn’t quite know where you were going with how I could
reassure investors, I'm glad that’s the way you ended up on.
Scott Hamilton, Bloomberg News: About stability.
Mark Carney: No, look I’ll say two things. First is that it is an absolute
privilege to have this role and it’s a tremendous
responsibility. And we have been - it’s not going to surprise
you - we have been flat out since the run up to the vote
through to this discussion and beyond this discussion. And I
can candidly say I have not had a moment to sit back and
reflect on an issue that I said I wouldn’t come back to until
the end of the year. So I appreciate the question, but I don’t
have an update because we’ve been - it’s a privilege to have
the job and we’ve been doing the job. Thanks.

Mathijs Schiffers,
Dutch Financial Times: You said you are not a fan of negative interest rates, but
what are your feelings about helicopter money?
Mark Carney: Well that’s - I'm trying to think of a way to express it. No, I
don’t see the merit in the strategy. Look, let me answer it
this way which is that we have a range of tools. We still have
scope under all the tools we announced today. There are
other things we could do if necessary. It might not be
necessary that we have to provide additional stimulus, it
depends on how the economy unfolds and how the trade-off
evolves, but there's not a need and I can’t conceive of a
situation in which there would be a need to have such flights
of fancy here in the UK.
Helen Thomas, BBC: Governor, you mention in a couple of places here that
purchases of corporate bonds could actually have a greater
effect in the economy today than purchases of gilts. Given
that you've been very clear that you don’t see other easing
measures going much further, what is the scope to expand
that £10bn, given the overall size of that market?
Mark Carney: Two things. First I would say that again we see scope for all
of the measures we announced today to go further. But
secondly to answer specifically on corporates I'm going to ask
Minouche to answer that but also maybe give a bit of a
context, not just about going further but how we’re going to
run this, run the programme.
Minouche Shafik: Sure. We estimate that the sort of universe of firms that
would be eligible for our corporate bond purchases would be
about 150 firms and it’s roughly a market of about £150bn.
So we think that purchasing £10bn in that context is quite
feasible and there are various things we could do to expand
the universe of purchases. 
Page 23
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
But the initial focus will be on purchasing conventional,
senior, unsubordinated debt. We will look at only debt which
is corporate bonds which are rated investment grade by at
least one of the major agencies, but we will also do our own
assessment of creditworthiness. We’ll look at minimum
amounts of about £100m, and we will operate initially only in
the secondary market, so bonds that have been in the market
for at least a month.
So that’s where we’re going to start but as the Governor said
there are various ways we could expand that if the MPC
decided that it wanted further stimulus.
Facilitator: Last question.
Sam Nussey, Nikkei: Given this enormous uncertainty about what the future
relationship with not only the EU will look like and with the
rest of the world, and also how long it would take - some
people are suggesting two or three years, some people are
suggesting ten years, how does the Bank go about making
forecasts in that situation? And do you have a central case
that you’re using?
Mark Carney: We haven’t picked any particular model for the new
relationship with the EU. What we have assumed is that
there will be a period some point beyond the forecast horizon
where the degree of openness in the UK economy will be
somewhat lower than it is today. And just to follow that logic
through virtually any model, any new model of the EU
relationship, has some reduction in the degree of openness
compared to being a full member of the European Union;
that’s understandable. But we haven’t picked a specific one.
So if you just look on average in terms of probabilities you
come up with an adjustment.
It’s clearly the strategy of the UK government to more than
compensate for that reduced openness with the EU with 
Page 24
Inflation Report Q&A - 4.8.16
greater openness with the rest of the world. There's a
question in terms of the exact timing of the compensation,
given the time to negotiate trade deals. And so the basic
assumption, which is relevant to the model or to the forecast,
is some reduction in openness beyond the forecast horizon
which then affects some of the investment decisions today.
But of course what’s some of the big drivers? The big drivers
of this forecast are uncertainty about what we've just
discussed, of course which has an impact; the adjustments
that are going on and expected in property markets which
have an impact on demand; and some marginal increase in
the cost of capital. All of that flows through to the outcome.
So that’s where we end up. We don’t pick a model and it
wouldn’t be credible if we did.
Jenny Scott: Thank you very much everyone. That’s all we’ve got time for.
