Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
Phil Aldrick, The Times: I just wondered about Greece, and whether a Greece - a dirtyexit - would throw all of your forecasts off course and require
some - what kind of response would it require, do you think?
Mark Carney: Well, recognising that this is a hypothetical question, you
know, would a change in Greece's position have an impact on
the forecast? Yes. Would it have the same impact on the UK
economy as it would have had in 2012? No. There are
differences now than there were in 2012. They include
differences to the institutional arrangements in the euro area,
both facilities at the level of the euro area, but obviously
importantly facilities announced by the ECB - I'm speaking
specifically of OMTs, and of course coupled with the
demonstrated willingness of the ECB to use its full toolkit, as
appropriate, to meet its remit.
There are also differences since 2012 in terms of the track
records of the various economies - so-called peripheral
economies - within the eurozone. And those differences in
track records are certainly reflected in market yields. You've
seen yields on 10-year bonds of Ireland, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, etc., tighten over the course of the last several
months as these issues have risen up the focus of markets, at
the same time that obviously Greek spreads have moved
further out.
And the third reason why things were different is that the
scale of private sector exposure to Greece, both within the
euro area and certainly from the UK financial system, has
gone down.
And on that last point, just to be clear, I mean, one of the
advantages of the structure of the Bank is that we're
obviously the prudential supervisor as well as the monetary
authority. And so we have direct line of sight into the
exposures of our largest financial institutions to Greece. And
I can tell you that the level of that exposure is less than 2% 
Page 3
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
of common equity, and it has been coming down. So I'm
speaking specifically about the UK banking system here.
So for all those reasons there's a different order of
magnitude. But it would have an impact, and we would have
to assess that impact at the time. And, as I said in my
opening comments, we do have the means and the will, and
obviously the responsibility, to take whatever action is
necessary in any eventuality, in order to bring inflation back
to target within a reasonable time horizon.
Jennifer Ryan, Bloomberg News: It's a question about your inflation projections. So they're
shown as above target at the end of three years, but of
course market expectations have changed since then and are
now looking for a Q1 rate increase. So can you talk a little bit
about what that does to your interest forecast - not your
interest rate forecast - your inflation forecast? And, you
know, does that mean that at the end of the period they
should be back right down at the target perhaps? And also,
what does that mean for what investors are now thinking?
Are they actually now spot on?
Mark Carney: Well, as you know, Jennifer, we don't do real time updating of
our inflation forecast. The next one's due in the middle of
May, I think. Yeah, we get three months to think about these
questions, as Ben says.
Look, I think what is safest to say is that, using the curves
that we had at the time when we conducted the forecast,
which is the time at which we took our policy decision, last
week, that you did have that slight overshoot.
Jennifer Ryan, Bloomberg News: So what does that do to where markets ought to be right
now? I mean, are they wrong?
Mark Carney: Look - markets will - I think - let me go back to something I
said at my opening remarks, which is that what markets have 
Page 4
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
been doing since our last forecast in November is they
adjusted their expectations around the pace and degree of
rate increases, in an environment of some additional external
headwinds particularly to growth. So they adjusted them
down, and notably so. And I would suggest that they did that
because the market understands in general what the MPC is
trying to do.
What we have with today's Report and accompanying letter is
as much clarity as we can give about what our objective is.
So we're being very clear that we think that we should be
returning inflation - given the nature of the shocks that have
hit the economy, and given that most of the shocks that have
affected inflation have been one-off price level shocks - these
big commodity price shocks, we've been clear that we're
going to look through those. And given the absence of a
trade-off between output or employment and inflation, the
absence of that trade-off, that we should return inflation to
target as quickly as possible. And our judgement is, given all
that, within the next two years.
The market can take that information, can take other
developments, and make its own judgement about the exact
pace of those. And we won't provide a real time running
commentary on that, except I just - I think I should
underscore the point that what is consistent with our
objective, our stated objective of returning inflation within the
next two years, it is - it does require some limited and
gradual increases in interest rates over the forecast horizon.
Richard Edgar, ITV News: Perhaps, trying to make your comments slightly more
concrete. In your letter to the Chancellor, you refer to falling
prices and the action that you could take if deflation were to
set in. Should borrowers and savers be preparing then for a
rate cut, as we've seen today in Sweden, or a rate rise? 
Page 5
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
Mark Carney: Well, I think it's pretty clear, in terms of our central
expectation, that the most likely next move in monetary
policy is an increase in interest rates. As we've been saying
for some time, we expect those adjustments to be limited and
at a gradual pace, but the message is clear: in order to
achieve our objective, we're going to look through this onetime
adjustment - which in the end is good news, by and
large, for British households, recognising there are some
distributional impacts across the United Kingdom, but it's
good news for British households.
And we're going to look through that and ensure that inflation
comes back to target in a timely fashion. But that is
consistent with some rate increases over the forecast horizon,
in our judgement.
Estelle Shirbon, Reuters News: The pound hit its highest level against the euro in seven years
on Wednesday. I was wondering how much of a concern that
is for the Bank.
Mark Carney: Well, speaking from an inflation perspective, one of the drags
on inflation at present has been the impact of past
depreciation of sterling, not just against the Euro but against
a host of other currencies - Yen and others - particularly
emerging market currencies.
We're seeing that pass through also help dampen inflation.
It's not the most important factor, but it's also helping
dampen inflation right now. So it's something that we do
monitor. But, as I said before, our judgement is that, given
all those factors, given the shocks that have hit the UK at
present, we can chart a course which delivers inflation back
to target within an appropriate horizon.
Robert Peston, BBC: Good morning, Governor. You say that the months you
expect of zero inflation and the probability that it'll turn
negative is basically a good thing, that it reflects oil price 
Page 6
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
cuts, food price falls that are putting money into people's
pockets - spending power, augmented spending power for
shoppers. How would you know, how would you judge,
however, that good price falls were turning into bad
deflation? And if you were to judge that good price falls were
turning into pernicious deflation, what would you then do
about it?
Mark Carney: Right. Well, it's an important question, and we would
distinguish what's happening at present and what's likely to
happen over the course of the year from a - as you say - a
bad deflation outcome. This is - we've had a dramatic change
in a series of commodity prices, most notable oil - the biggest
move - the third biggest move in the last half-century. And
that's flowing through to the petrol pump.
That is different than persistent and widespread falls in
prices. So one of the things that we look at, and will continue
to look at, is all the components of the CPI - which of them
are falling? What is it relative to historic averages?
And in the letter, actually, we draw attention to this. It's - I
think the figure precisely is about 68% of the components are
rising - the components of CPI are rising.
Robert Peston, BBC: [inaudible]
Mark Carney: But they are rising, because obviously oil and food are rising -
I'm giving you the components that are actually increasing
within the CPI. That's bang on historic averages. So in other
words, we're seeing more concentrated falls in prices. So
there's nothing particularly unusual about the breadth of the
change in prices. And that's very important. So the first
element of your question is - what are we going to look at?
Well, we'll continue to look at the breadth of changes in
prices; look at the persistence there, but obviously monitor
inflation expectations very closely. And we do; as detailed in 
Page 7
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
the Report, inflation expectations are consistent with the 2%
target. We list all the ones that we look at - more than half
are in line with historic averages, but again, we will watch
that - watch that closely. We'll also watch developments on
the wage front as well, to the extent that wage patterns start
to be affected.
I think the important point, which is entirely from a
contingency or risk management perspective, is to
underscore that, if we were in a situation (which we are not in
at the moment), but if we ever were in a situation where we
needed to provide additional stimulus, we have many options
- we have many options to provide that stimulus, and the
effectiveness of the stimulus is reinforced by the relative
health of the financial system as well.
But just to bring it back to where we are today, we see these
one-off changes in prices. Good news. Helps support real
incomes - we expect the strongest real income growth in over
a decade actually. And as a consequence of that and other
factors, our view is that the most likely moves on monetary
policy are rate increases.
Bill Keegan, Observer: I wondered, Governor, whether you've had any reaction from
Berlin, Brussels or Frankfurt to the points you made in your
Dublin speech about the fiscal deficiencies of the eurozone?
Mark Carney: The issues in that speech - the true answer is yes - and the
issues in that speech around - let me generalise it first and I'll
get to the specifics, which is the importance of building
greater private and public risk sharing in the eurozone. So
banking union, capital markets union, absolutely essential,
but also some element of public risk sharing related to fiscal
arrangements, just as we have here in the United Kingdom -
as virtually any currency union has. 
Page 8
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
Those issues have been discussed in the past. Those issues
were publicly aired in the report of the four presidents a few
years ago. And I have had discussions with my counterparts
both prior to the speech and subsequent to the speech, both
in central banks and ministries, on these issues.
These are medium term issues; they're not conjunctural
issues - it's not about short-term stance of policy, but it's
about structuring a viable currency union. I mean, I will say -
and if I can bring this back to - and I would say there's a
much more general recognition of these issues than one
might expect.
If I can bring it back the UK. Again, speaking from a
structural perspective, one of the reasons why the fall in oil
prices is unambiguously good for the UK economy, even
though there are distributional consequences - there's
impacts in Aberdeen, there's impacts in a series of businesses
that support the energy sector - is because we have longerterm
fiscal arrangements. And those structural fiscal
arrangements have the impact - and it's referenced in the
Dublin speech - that the impact on fiscal capacity in Scotland,
for example, is only one tenth of what it would have been in
their absence.
And that's one way that the benefits of lower oil are recycled
through this economy, which helps smooth the adjustment.
Inaudible question
Mark Carney: The issues are well appreciated, I would say. No, I mean, I
think it's an issue in terms of understanding the economics of
the issue. The question is the timeline and the mechanics of
addressing it.
Larry Elliott, the Guardian: One thing that recent history has told us is that the Bank's
forecasts are unlikely to pan out exactly the way you expect 
Page 9
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
them to. And you say that the risks around them are broadly
balanced. I just wondered whether you could explore that a
bit more, because one option here - one risk - would be that
we have something similar to what happened after the
1985/86 fall in oil prices, that there was a very big increase in
consumption in the UK. Low borrowing costs set off much
higher growth than people imagined. That's one risk.
The other risk is that the dynamics that have kept inflation
falling, the underlying reasons for it - low wage increases, lots
of slack in the labour market - that that continues, which has
really been the more recent history, that throughout the last
two or three years expectations of when Bank Rate will rise
have been pushed further and further backwards.
So I just wonder - do you really think those risks are equally
balanced or do you have a hunch which way it's more likely to
turn out? Are we likely to see much stronger levels of activity
and higher inflation, as it was in the mid to late 1980s, or are
we likely to see a continuation of what we've seen in the
more recent past?
Mark Carney: Let me say a couple of words, then I'm going to pass to Ben
to give his perspective on it.
I think the thing that we have seen in recent months is the
start of the turn of wages, and consistent with the change in
slack in the labour market. So we've seen the start of that.
Now I wouldn't over-play that; it's still relatively early days,
and actually I might take an opportunity just to point out that
we think there are going to be some base effects that impact
the average weekly earnings numbers in the course of the
next couple of months. So we may see sequentially a little
slowing in that, but on an annual basis we still see - we still
expect to see a pick-up. 
Page 10
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
That provides some balance to that downside risk. That’s the
first point I'd like to make. The second is that what's
important is that it's recognised that we will fulfil our
responsibilities, by which I mean we're going to have a period
where headline inflation is low - very low - for most of this
year, and that's a good thing in general because of the
causes of it. It's not a good thing if it persists, though,
because a little bit of inflation greases the wheels of the
economy, as you know. And so the recognition that we're
going to be responsible in the calibration of policy, so that
inflation comes back to target. But that feeds into
expectations of employers and of workers in setting wages
and in planning investments.
But I might ask Ben to say a bit broader about how we
construct risks and how we think about this.
Ben Broadbent: Thanks. Well you're right to highlight the risks and that's
why we have Fan Charts and not just point forecasts and we
continually make an effort to remind people of that. And you
can judge from the width of those the sort of scale of the
risks we're talking about.
One thing I would say though, with reference to your
comparison with the 1980s, is that of course the policy
regime, and specifically the monetary policy regime is very,
very different. And throughout that era, throughout the '70s,
and the '80s actually, inflation was far more volatile than it is
now. I mean, if we'd drawn a Fan Chart then without an
inflation target I think it would have been a lot wider.
Now that improvement was flattered probably by the years of
the great stability. My predecessor predicted at the beginning
of - when the Bank was first granted independence over
monetary policy that we'd be writing a letter 40% of the time.
So things got even better than that, probably not for reasons,
or at least solely for reasons to do with the improvement in 
Page 11
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
monetary policy. But I don't think that the '80s are a
relevant comparison for the sort of scale of the risks to
inflation we're talking about.
Chris Giles, Financial Times: It's a question either for the Governor or maybe Minouche.
Interest rate futures markets have moved very, very rapidly
in the last few days from a position far away from the
Inflation Report, to one which is almost entirely in line with
the Inflation Report. Are you worried that you might have
had some data security breaches of this Inflation Report such
that the forecast might have leaked out to the markets and
what might you do about that?
Mark Carney: Well I can take that, I have absolutely no reason to have
those worries. There's been adjustments - there's always
adjustments in markets in terms of expectations of stance of
policy. And one of the things, as you know, Chris, is that our
future, our forward OIS curve, is quite flat and so relatively
modest moves can translate into relatively large moves in
calendar space. So you can move easily from the fall of 2016
to the spring of 2016 with relatively small moves.
But look, no, we have - you know you have the joy of being
locked up here when we release various documents. We
have very robust security procedures and I have absolutely
no reason to credit that concern.
Helia Ebrahimi, CNBC: A bit more on wages, do you think it's irrelevant now to call
for companies to raise people's wages, given you're
forecasting that household incomes rates grow at their fastest
pace in a decade, or is there a real risk still of deflationary
pressures becoming entrenched until we see real wage rises?
Mark Carney: Well I think - this is a risk we're looking to guard against.
And I think I would say that this is a strength of this system
is that, given how low inflation, is there's a need to write a
letter to explain why that's there and what we're going to do 
Page 12
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
about it, and provide as much clarity as possible. And that
should help inform wage setting. And you know - and I think
the message is we're quite comfortable in giving message of
our ability to bring inflation back to target in a timely fashion.
In terms of the dynamics of the labour market, it continues to
tighten broadly as we had expected, so slack has - our
estimate of slack has come down to the region of a half a
percent. We are seeing, as I referenced earlier, and we
reference in the Report, tangible increases in wages. It's still
relatively early days. The survey measures support that as
well; our agent discussions support that as well. And by
having an opportunity to make clear that there is a good
element to these falls in prices, the falls in commodity prices,
and that that will reinforce, in our expectation, consumer
spending. That should help support a well-functioning labour
market. So we're not making an appeal to companies in
order to do something, we're just observing what we expect
is most likely to happen.
David Smith, Sunday Times: It's a very similar point, but I noticed in the last MPC minutes
there was a concern that pay settlements would follow
inflation down and you'll be watching that closely.
Mark Carney: Yes.
David Smith, Sunday Times: In this Report you've revised up your predictions for average
earnings growth, which presumably is on a basis of
unemployment coming down more quickly. But that's still
alongside fairly weak productivity growth, certainly for this
year and not particularly strong in future years. Do you think
that's a rather bold forecast on earnings growth, given where
we are now and where we've been in the last few years?
Mark Carney: Yeah, well - I'll invite Ben to amplify, but I think we're quite
comfortable with the central expectation of that forecast
given the tightening in the labour market. As you know, the 
Page 13
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
dynamics of consumer spending are reinforced obviously by
the improvement in real incomes that comes from the
changes - the temporary changes in prices. And that we are
conscious of the risk that there could be persistence in lower
wages, you know, just this long period of relatively weak
earnings growth could have an element of persistence which
could delay this adjustment, and that's one of the downside
risks.
And to be clear again, to map the risks, and then I will ask
Ben to amplify. In our famous Fan Chart of the inflation
forecast we do have a slight skew in the next year - downside
skew in the next year - just because of the possibility that
there could be a little more persistence once prices are low,
that it could just extend for a little longer. But we think that
comes away within the two-year horizon.
Ben Broadbent: The only thing I'd add is just to highlight the importance of,
as you have yourself, of the productivity growth forecast on
which all this depends. We wouldn't view that in the longerterm
comparison as unduly optimistic. We have it improving,
but we have that rate of growth only just getting back, by the
end of the forecast, to the average of the pre-crisis growth
rates.
So yes, it's faster than we've seen in the three or four years
since the crisis and therefore earnings growth is also faster.
But I think, viewed on the long term perspective, I wouldn't
say it's overly optimistic.
Ben Chu, The Independent: Governor, a question about the risks posed by household
balance sheets. Other forecasters, not least the Office for
Budget Responsibility, have projected a very large increase in
the level of household leverage and a sharp decline in the
savings ratio. I'm just wondering what your view is of those
developments. Do they pose a risk that people become
overleveraged? You do project an increase in consumer 
Page 14
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
spending; how worried are you about unsecured lending, etc.,
increasing?
Mark Carney: Well, I think I would speak more broadly for the Bank,
including the FPC, that we continue to monitor quite closely
developments in household balance sheets. And we view,
you know, when we viewed the risks around the housing
market it was through the lens of household balance sheets in
the medium term as being the biggest medium-term risk to
the UK economy, and that remains the case.
I would observe though that there has been improvement in
household balance sheets. British households have paid
down about 20 percentage points of debt to income. That
ratio is still above its longer-term average, but it has been
coming down. The savings - because of the growth in wages,
the combination of growth in wages and lower inflation in the
near term, actually, even though we have a fairly robust
outlook for consumption, the savings rate holds up in this
forecast. So this is not a debt-fuelled expansion in our
forecast; it is something we watch.
I'd make a last point which is a general one, which is that the
UK as a whole, while it was quite over-levered obviously into
the crisis, the UK as a whole - the private non-financial
sector, so households and corporates have actually been one
of the only sectors that have - internationally - that have delevered
and the combination of the two has been in the order
of 30 percentage points of GDP. So there's been a fairly
notable deleveraging; so there's progress there. But the
motivation for your question is still spot on; we do see these
issues across the Bank as the most important over the
medium term.
Louise Cooper, Freelance: I also want to ask about inflation. If you look at the scale of
your cuts to the inflation forecast, it's really been quite
dramatic. On the outside chance on your Fan Charts, you do 
Page 15
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
predict potentially a minus 2% inflation figure on Chart 5.13,
Page 49. And also on Page 33 there's a Chart A, the impact
of a fall in oil prices on inflation will be short-lived, but that
assumes a 10% fall in oil prices. Actually what oil prices have
done, as we all know, they've halved and the scale and the
size of that fall has been almost unprecedented. What are
your forecasts for the oil price going forward and how does
that feed into your inflation forecasts?
Mark Carney: The first thing is that yeah, there's a large move relative to
November. Four fifths of that move, relative to November, is
accounting for the fall in the oil price between when we did
the November Report and when we did this Report. I'll just
remind - I think you know this, Louise, but this Report gets
locked down when we make the decision, which was last
week, and oil prices at the time of that decision. So from a
spot perspective - and we use spot oil and then we use the
futures curve, because it's a neutral assumption. It's not a
fantastic predictor of future oil prices; the spot is arguably the
best, but we're not going to get into the business of
forecasting the oil price. So we use the futures curve.
That futures curve, for what it's worth, and it's going to keep
moving around I'm sure, but that futures curve since last
week and today has moved up fairly substantially. And so if
we were to use today's futures curve as opposed to then, you
would see that Fan coming up.
We did the rule - you know gave some sensitivities in terms
of the impact of change in the oil price on UK growth, so that
people can do their own analysis around it and the immediate
pass-through to inflation because oil is going to move around.
And because oil is going to move around, I think it just
reinforces the point - if I can make a policy point - it
reinforces the point that we're not going to swing around
monetary policy to try to chase oil, not just because it's 
Page 16
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
volatile, but also because the lags on monetary policy are
such that it would not have the effect that we intended.
Louise Cooper, Freelance: But how much of a risk do you think a lower oil price poses to
your inflation forecasts?
Mark Carney: Well I think the - I wouldn't put it in the - in terms of the
actual inflation outcome, it will be affected by big swings in
crude prices. You know, if we have another 50% swing in
crude prices, yeah, that will have a notable impact on the
inflation forecast.
The issue, the fundamental issue in terms of the functioning
of the economy is - does that generalise, does that pass
through to broader prices? Does that pass through to
people's expectations of inflation? And again, I'm slightly
repeating myself, but the advantage of the system that is
here is that we have opportunities, not just through the
Inflation Report, but also through the letter writing process,
to explain why inflation has moved, what we're going to do
about it, and over what time horizon, so that people's
expectations can be informed by that.
Richard Barley,
Wall Street Journal: Governor, a number of central banks have cut rates into
negative territory, Sweden most recently this morning, and
bond yields are negative in a number of European markets.
The Bank highlights that, were it necessary, it now thinks it
could cut rates from 0.5. Has the concept of a lower bound
for rates been scrapped? And what are the risks around
these unusual negative rates and negative yields?
Mark Carney: Well I think - thank you for the question. I think the different
countries, different jurisdictions, have different financial
systems, different arrangements and therefore will have
different concepts of the lower bound. And I'm going to ask
Minouche to add to this. 
Page 17
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
The relevant factors in the UK and the sort of limiting factor
in the UK had been previously the relative strength of the
banking system and the building societies, the capital position
of those. And given the asset liability mix of those
institutions, what impact would an even lower Bank Rate than
50 basis points have on their ability to rebuild capital?
Now as you know, we've made a lot of progress, and those
institutions have made a lot of progress in rebuilding capital.
So because we had to write the letter, because we had to
explain all the contingencies and the various risks in the
context of the letter, and because just naturally we
continually update our thinking on what we could do if we
have to ease, whether it's on the asset purchase side, or with
respect to Bank Rate, we provided an updated view on that.
I'm going to ask Minouche to say a word on market
functioning, but I will say just a general point which is, there
is still a lower bound in these other jurisdictions; it's a
question of exactly where it is, and they're taking an
assessment. At some point holding cash makes sense
relative to using the system, but I don't know if you want to
talk about …
Minouche Shafik: I think as the Governor said there are two main risks of going
negative. One is the risk of people reverting to cash - both
financial institutions and households - and also the worry
about what happens to money markets when rates are
negative. So there's a little bit of a time limit as to how long,
we don't know how long until it becomes desirable for people
to go into cash. But I think, as the Governor said earlier,
we're not there yet, so we have the advantage of observing
what happens in those several countries now that have
negative interest rates, to see what the consequences are for
those two issues. 
Page 18
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15

Harry Daniels, Live Squawk: Just a question really on central banks and getting the
message across. Do you believe central bank credibility
should be sacrificed for monetary policy goals? I refer to the
Swiss National Bank and their recent moves last month - and
how you balance the two: your monetary policy goals and
credibility after, you know, what we saw in the "black swan"
event there?
Mark Carney: Well I think, and all colleagues would agree, that our
credibility is essential to consistently meet monetary policy
goals. And the way we can most effectively reinforce that
credibility - and it’s a constant task to continue to reinforce
and add to that credibility - the way we can best do that is to
be clear about exactly what we’re trying to accomplish.
Again, that’s the advantage of this process. It’s not just the
2% inflation target but it’s over what horizon, given the
shocks that are hitting the economy, and how we’re going to
go about achieving that.
And then, amongst many other things, providing as
transparent and complete analysis as possible and finally
answering questions around that, both from you, from market
participants, from businesses and from households, to explain
that.
And the last element which I would add is something that
we’ve been trying to do at the Bank, and this is based on
recommendations of Stockton and others, but is to go back
and assess where our forecasts have turned out to be wrong
or not consistent with what actually transpired, why that was
the case, why those errors were there, and if there are any
broader lessons to be learnt from that.
Jenny Scott: Sorry, we’ve got quite a few other people to get through.
Hugo. 
Page 19
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
Hugo Duncan, Daily Mail: Governor, how concerned are you and the MPC about the
balance of the recovery? You've obviously raised your
household consumption forecasts but trimmed export
forecasts and cut quite heavily your business investment
forecasts. And on the latter, how concerned are you about
uncertainty surrounding the general election, British politics,
this year on business investment and possibly the wider
economy?
Mark Carney: Right, start with the general concerns about the balance of
the recovery. It is not having an impact at this stage on the
stance of monetary policy. It is something we discuss,
something we track. There is - our consumption forecast is
obviously supported, as I've said, both by our outlook for
wages but also the dividend, if you will, in the short term
from lower energy prices.
In terms of the investment forecast, I'll make a specific point
and then general. Near term investment, most of the
adjustment to near term investment is because of lower
expected investment in the North Sea, so it’s notable and you
picked it up. And it’s not an adjustment because of change in
broad investment intentions, which gets to the last bit of your
question which is around uncertainty, whether it’s
geopolitical, European or domestic. We, like our agents, our
discussions are picking up elements of domestic uncertainty,
as are the CBI surveys, as are the British Chamber of
Commerce surveys as well. What we haven’t seen is that yet
being translated into changes in investment plans, and we
certainly haven’t seen it affecting actual investment in real
time. So the forward investment intentions are at this stage
holding out even though there has been a pickup in
observation about uncertainty in general, including domestic
elements of it.
Henry Curr, The Economist: Does the case for looking through the effects of the oil price
fall hinge on the fact that that’s unanticipated or that it’s 
Page 20

external? Let’s say that the futures curve did show an oil
price change which you were able to offset because it was
sufficiently far in the future, would you happily steer domestic
demand to offset that or is it domestic inflationary pressure
that you really care about?
Mark Carney: Yeah, if only the future curve were that good a predictor. But
let me take your hypothetical up a level, if I may, which is
that if we could foresee some sort of persistent disinflationary
or deflationary force that we had quite a high probability that
that was going to keep us off target, all other things being
equal, and that that were going to persist you know beyond
the usual horizon of two years, three years and beyond. And
an example of that might have been the impact of, you know,
Chinese - I’ll simplify it to Chinese manufacturing at the turn
of the millennium - one could have foreseen that. Given our
remit, given our mandate, should we lean against that in
order to achieve the inflation target? Yes is the short answer,
given that we have operational independence, a clear remit,
we would have to explain why we’re doing that and make it
transparent.
In a world where that is a positive supply shock, it’s good
disinflation. One might want to have a conversation about
whether or not that should be kept. Now I'm getting into the
hypothetical of the hypothetical, so I should probably just
stop. But it’s going to be a pretty unique circumstance where
one can have a central bank or even The Economist can have
the confidence that there is this force that has that impact
and it’s likely to persist as opposed to being just a shock, so
it’s enduring. But again, to repeat myself, the short answer,
given the remit, is if we knew it and we could lean against it,
we would.
Mike Bird, Business Insider: I'm just looking at chart 1.1 as well, the forward rates
internationally. One of the interesting things is the fairly
sharp change in the intersection between the US and UK 
Page 21
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
curves. I think if you go back to about summer last year,
people were certainly expecting a Bank Rate hike before and
the market is now implying a sort of July or so hike from the
Fed, a lot longer from the UK. Obviously I won’t ask you to
comment on the Fed’s reaction function, but how would you
characterise the differences in the recovery and inflation
prospects between the UK and the US?
Mark Carney: Well the expansion in the US, say generally, the expansion in
the US is more developed; it’s been going on longer than it
has been in the UK. We’ve had quite different labour market
dynamics. The US had a sharp fall in participation; it’s now
starting to come back, whereas we’ve had the opposite.
We’ve had - I think we’d characterise it as a positive labour
supply shock; there's been more workers coming into the
market, and that’s had implications for the path of wages
here.

In terms of the inflation dynamics, we have - as a
consequence of the differences in the labour market, there
have been some distinctions in - there are differences, I
mean there are basically differences in the net inflation
dynamics. I know you’re not suggesting this but just to avoid
any doubt, we’re not in a situation where we’re so tightly
bound to the US economy, or we would take so much
information from what happens in the US economy, that
monetary policy in the UK would move either in lock step or
follow closely behind that in the US. And I don’t think - make
a market comment - I don’t think that there's confusion about
that in the market. I think we’ve seen our curve move by
and large - by and large - consistent with the forces that are
operating here.
Ian King, Sky News: You talk in the Report about the fact that labour force - the
labour participation rate has been lower than expected in
recent months. To what do you put that down? And what
are the implications for you if that continues with regard to 
Page 22
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
what the Prime Minister was saying the other day about
wanting Britain to have a pay rise?
Mark Carney: Well, let me say one general - let me make a general point
and then I’ll ask Ben to speak about the specifics of it. Which
is that one of the things that the MPC has been discussing has
been how to update our thinking around potential growth,
components on the labour side or with respect to
productivity. And of course we get information about both of
those on a daily basis and there's a temptation to make
adjustments in every report.
I think what we’re minded to do - and we’ll probably start
doing this in May - is to set out episodically or periodically
update on it, not episodically, periodically update our views -
so in terms of the so-called equilibrium variables. I'm sorry
this is a tacky answer, you don’t want that, but Ben will give
you a real answer. So whether it’s around participation rate -
your question, or around the natural rate of unemployment or
the amount of average hours reported. And so we take stock
and we’re clear and then we hold those for a while.
What we’ve been seeing is that actual participation has come
out lower, first than we would have necessarily expected, but
a gap has opened up between what we think is a sort of
equilibrium level of participation and what we’re actually
observing.
Ben Broadbent: The only thing I’d add is - if you look at the numbers and
they’re in Chart 3.5 which is on page 25, you can see that in
the short term they’re pretty volatile. The broad judgement
we’ve made, which I think is the right one, is that quite a bit
of the decline in this we saw, particularly when we went into
recession in 2008/9, was cyclical, which is to say that a lot of
the people who lost their jobs rather than looking for work
and being counted as unemployed, instead sort of dropped 
Page 23
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
out of the labour force but that they would be able to come
back relatively easily.
And that basically remains our judgement. And indeed as the
economy has recovered you've seen, except for this dip in the
last three months, a revival in productivity growth. So that’s
broadly still the judgement we’re making and it’s one of the
sources therefore in the forecast of potential supply growth
and employment growth over the next two to three years.
Duncan Weldon, Newsnight: The current account deficit is currently near a record level,
about 6% of GDP, and over your forecast period you say that
gradually improves but the deficit remains wide. And that
sounds more pessimistic than the OBR’s forecast who see
quite a rapid improvement in elements of the current
account. You say in the Key Judgements - the magnitude of
the current account deficit suggests some risk to the
sustainability of the growth outlook. So it’s a two-part
question, how big a risk and over what time period will you
be watching that risk?
Mark Carney: Well you’re right; the current account deficit is let’s say at a
record level. I mean it’s been bouncing around a bit, but at
6% of GDP it’s at a record level. I think the first thing is to
look at why has it deteriorated, why has it shifted. And the
answer is not in the trade balance, it’s not actually in the
relative performance of exports and imports - both have been
growing less rapidly than expected, but in terms of balance it
hasn’t moved so much. The big news has been in the swing
in our net investment income, and quite a substantial swing.
And it counts for the lion’s share of the shift in the current
account.
Now why is that the case? Well you'd look at the big areas
where British investments are. Top of the list is in the euro
area, so much lower returns on - and these are real
investments, so lower returns on real investment in Europe. 
Page 24
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
And that could persist for some time, so this issue could
persist for some time.
When you run a current account deficit, you’re relying on
foreign inflows of capital. So it matters how you finance it in
terms of the sustainability, and that depends on the relative
attractiveness of a country, as ultimately it depends on the
relative attractiveness of investments in a country.
At present the relative growth prospects in the UK are near
the head of the pack in the advanced economies, and with
our forecasts and the IMF's forecasts - you could take an
independent one - that’s likely to continue. So that makes it
attractive. But also the UK is an attractive destination for
foreign direct investment; it gets the lion's share - a
disproportionate large share, I should say - of foreign direct
investment for countries in the European Union. And so it
underscores the importance of continuing to remain an
attractive destination for investment.
We have looked, the last point I’ll make on this, Duncan, is
that we have looked not as the MPC but as the FPC, we have
looked at what could happen, what could be the implications
of a sharper adjustment in the current account. What if we
no longer could rely on the kindness of strangers, if you will.
And that was the motivation for the stress test we ran and
the results were released in December. And it’s a
hypothetical scenario, but it is one that connects the dots
from a tightening current account position to the implications
for growth for in that case house prices, bank balance sheets.
And the punch line on that wasn’t a great scenario, it
wouldn’t have been a fun thing to live through; it was an
extreme scenario and it was a stress scenario. But the punch
line on that was that our determination was that the core of
the system, the core of the banking system, was resilient to 
Page 25
Inflation Report Q&A - 12.2.15
that form of shock and still would have been able to provide
lending to the UK economy.
Jenny Scott: Okay, last question.
Nathalie Webb, Share Radio: Because you say that housing investment and mortgage
approvals are down, they’re weaker than expected, do you
see any sort of changes to try and encourage the banks to
lend a bit more because also people have got more
disposable income to create a bit more stimulus in that area?
Mark Carney: No, I would say the - you know we have our, from a
monetary policy perspective, we have our forecast of housing
activity; it is lower than it had been previously. From a
broader perspective, broader Bank of England perspective,
whether it’s the PRA or the FPC, our focus has been to ensure
that bank underwriting standards remain responsible. We’re
not looking to encourage a shift towards - you would say it’s
a surprise - we’re not looking to encourage a shift towards
irresponsibility or so-called reckless lending. That was the
motivation of the steps that the FPC took in the spring of last
year to limit the amount of high loan to income mortgages
that could be written, and that remains the case.
By taking those steps, and I’ll end with this on monetary
policy, by taking those steps, by reducing risks, financial
stability risks that could arise from irresponsible lending in
the housing market, risks that go back to the question about
debt, Ben’s question about debt. The FPC preserves room for
the MPC to conduct monetary policy to provide the
appropriate amount of stimulus in order to get inflation back
to target. Because if the FPC weren’t doing its job as the first
line of defence, then the MPC would have to potentially take
these considerations into account, which would be difficult at
the current juncture. Thank you.
Jenny Scott: Thanks very much everyone.
