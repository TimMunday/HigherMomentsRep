Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
Richard Edgar, ITV News: Governor, the Election result was a surprise to everyone.
Was it a surprise to the Bank? And if it was, how have you
adjusted your forecast for growth in the economy?
Mark Carney: Well, Richard, we forecast many things, but we don't forecast
political outcomes; we take them as they come and then we
adjust to the consequences of those decisions. So if the
people - whether it's the people of Scotland, the people of the
United Kingdom, people of Greece, etc.
 The most important stance of policy in general, for monetary
policy, over the monetary policy horizon, is the stance of
fiscal policy. We take the stance of fiscal policy as given, and
then we optimise monetary policy around that. This forecast
is consistent with the most recent budget of the last
government. As I indicated in my comments, there is
persistent fiscal drag in this forecast, just as there has been
over the last several years. That's one of the headwinds that
weighs on the economy. It's one of the reasons why the path
of Bank Rate, when it does rise, is likely to move at a gradual
pace and to a limited extent.
 The other point I would make in terms of overall policy is that
there are a host of policies and decisions, both within the
United Kingdom and abroad, that influence the productivity of
this economy. And what you start to see in this forecast is
the constraints of slower productivity, slower supply growth,
on the pace of the expansion of the United Kingdom
economy.
Larry Elliott, The Guardian: Can I just follow up on Richard's question? The last time the
government came into power with a quite aggressive fiscal
consolidation programme, five years ago, there was a marked
fall in the growth rate of the economy over the subsequent
two years. What's going to be different this time? 
Page 3
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
Mark Carney: Well, it depends on the path of fiscal policy, which depends
on the decision of the government. As I said to the last
question, we've incorporated the fiscal policy of the last
government. The question is how the new government adjust
policy and the extent to which those are adjustments within a
broad fiscal envelope - in other words, different spending and
tax priorities within a broad fiscal stance - or there is a shift
in the actual fiscal stance.
 As the monetary authority, we will take fiscal policy as given.
We'll adjust our forecast with fiscal policies that are tabled in
the House, not a series of comments that are made in the
course of an election campaign. So we'll adjust when there is
an actual budget.
Larry Elliott, The Guardian: The reason I ask is because there were £25bn worth of
spending cuts in the Conservative Party Manifesto, £13bn
worth of departmental cuts and £12bn worth of welfare cuts.
And the Prime Minister has said explicitly that that manifesto
will be implemented in full. So I'm quite surprised you're
saying that you haven't taken that into account in your
forecast.
Mark Carney: Well, Larry, there were - in all cases of all parties, but let's
take the party that's forming the government - there were
also spending commitments in their manifestos and in their
comments. So the question is - which cuts are implemented,
which spending commitments are put in place, any
adjustments - any other adjustments to the overall fiscal
stance? Instead of speculating on what might happen, one
waits a relatively short period of time for the subsequent
budget of the government, and adjusts accordingly.
 I think what we know, sitting here, is that the broad stance of
fiscal policy is restrictive, as it has been for the last several
years and is likely to continue for the next several years. And 
Page 4
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
that has a broad-brush consequence for the stance of
monetary policy in order for us to achieve the inflation target.
 But, I think you'll understand this, there's no point trying to
assess in an incomplete manner what might happen in a
relatively short period of time, when we will have all that
information and can adjust our forecast accordingly.
David Smith, Sunday Times: Governor, I wonder if I could ask you to elaborate on your
comments on the equilibrium interest rate. Were you saying
that thinking on the MPC is evolving on what the equilibrium
interest rate might be when the headwinds from the crisis
drop out - in other words that the new norm may not be as
different from the old norm? Or was it just a message to the
markets that the markets don't seem to be taking on board
what existing thinking was on the equilibrium interest rate?
Mark Carney: Well, let's break this into the equilibrium interest rate and
markets, because there's two elements, and obviously
ultimately they should come together, but there can be long
periods of divergence.
 First thing to say about the equilibrium interest rate - you
know this, but I think it's useful to go through the context - is
our view - and it was consistent with the stance of policy and
it's consistent with the performance of the economy - was
that that equilibrium rate went wildly negative during the
course of the depths of the crisis and the immediate
aftermath of the crisis, which is why my predecessors
instituted a large quantitative easing programme, other asset
purchase programmes, to get effective interest rates to a
negative level - if I can use that shorthand - to get them
below that equilibrium interest rate.
 With time, with repair of the financial system, that policy
increasingly effective, and I would suggest that we're still in a
position that the effective interest rate in the United Kingdom 
Page 5
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
is below the equilibrium interest rates. That's why, in
general, the economy is growing above our estimate of
potential growth; that's why spare capacity is being used up;
and that's why - over time - inflationary pressures will begin
to build. That's a good thing; that's what we want. We want
the economy moving back towards the equilibrium.
 We think that many of the headwinds which kept the
equilibrium rate down, which kept it effectively negative, are
dissipating, but some of them are not being eliminated.
Okay. So, the difficulties at the core of the financial system,
those are largely going away - have largely gone away and
are going away. Banks have recapitalised, they have more
liquidity; you see it in credit surveys, you see it in access to
credit for small and medium sized enterprises. Clearly for
households, the access to credit - particularly secured credit -
is at record low. Those are going away.
 The weakness in foreign demand - the relevant foreign
demand for the UK - has lessened, but it hasn't gone away,
and we don't expect it to go away over the forecast horizon.
We still have UK weighted foreign demand slightly less rapid
than historical averages.
 Fiscal, which we've talked about this morning, fiscal drag
continues there over the forecast horizon, and again weighs
on equilibrium interest rates. And I'd suggest as a last point,
which is more of a prediction than a fact at present in
markets, is that, with time, we will see higher intermediation
spreads in financial markets. Some of the consequences of
developments of liquidity in markets, some of which can be
expected, is that those higher liquidity costs will be passed on
to borrowers. And that will keep equilibrium interest rates
lower than they were in the past.
 So the sum of all that is we think that the rate is rising, that it
will continue to rise over the forecast horizon, but it won't go 
Page 6
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
back to historic levels. We can't give you - I won't be able to
give you a precise point estimate either of where the rate is
today, where it will be three years' time. We can tell
something though about the behaviour of the economy, given
the stance of policy. And the fact that in our view the
economy is going to return to slightly above trend growth
rates means that we do have a stimulative stance of policy,
notwithstanding the strength of sterling and other factors.
That's equilibrium interest rate.
 Turning to financial markets, there's a variety of factors that
influence bond rates in the UK. Some of it is an estimate of
exactly what I've just been talking about; some of it is -
much of it is a spillover from global bond market conditions.
We've seen in the course of the last several months a marked
influence of conditions in European bond markets that have
weighed on yields in the United Kingdom. Some of that is
reversing now, so I think it a poignant time - I'll finish here -
is that you can't take a direct mapping from bond markets to
where we think the equilibrium interest rate is.
Robert Peston, BBC: A couple of things, really. One was - given how unbelievably
lacklustre productivity has been in terms of revival over the
past few years, how worried should we be that you've
downgraded your expectations for growth in productivity?
 And has there been any work at the Bank of England to
assess the possible impact on growth of business
uncertainties created by the EU Referendum?
Mark Carney: Right. Let me take the last point. I'll introduce productivity,
then I'll hand to Ben to supplement, if I may.
 In terms of - let's call it political uncertainties in general, so
uncertainty about the outcome of the Election, which would
encapsulate potential referenda questions. 
Page 7
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
 What we've persistently picked up in our agency visits, in our
bilateral conversations with businesses, in broader surveys
(you would have seen the same surveys), is that there was
an awareness of this uncertainty, but what we were guided
was that companies were not acting on that uncertainty. I
should actually make that a double negative - they were not
not acting on that uncertainty. So it hadn't influenced yet
investment plans.
 Now we think in the end, with revisions over time, that the
data will broadly support that, so we do take that as probably
being accurate. So we are looking at this and we'll continue
to look at this very closely, because it could be an important
determinant of the forecast. As, with time, there's greater
clarity about the timing of a referendum, the question, the
prospects - all those issues - as that starts to come into the
public domain it will be relevant.
 And turn to productivity. In terms of the shortfall, our
marking down on productivity, I would emphasise a couple of
things. One is that we have done more work on these socalled
compositional effects, which - so it's the nature of jobs
and it's the nature of people filling jobs. So some of these
jobs are lower productivity, low-skilled, low productivity jobs -
and we've had a disproportionate number of those. That's a
cyclical phenomenon, that weighs on productivity. First point.
And it's detailed a bit in the Report.
 The second thing is you get people who are new to jobs, who
are not productive as they are with time. And again, in an
upturn, another cyclical factor; so those people will become
more productive. And so some of that weight we think is
going to come off the productivity performance of the
statistics.
 We've decided, our judgement - we could be wrong - but that
this effect is going to last a little longer than we thought 
Page 8
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
previously. That was one of the things we took from the
supply update.
 But then you get to more fundamental, other determinants.
We think that there's an element here of slowness in
recycling capital from low productivity to high productivity
firms. Some of that could be because of forbearance, partly
because of the interest rate stance. Some of it is because of
lower investment in the past, less capital deepening. And the
question is whether there are other intangible factors that
could be influencing, but Ben, come in on that.
Ben Broadbent: I think the Governor has just touched on all the main points.
You're right, it's been disappointing, particularly over the last
year or so during the recovery, the last two years when
normally the cyclical pattern would be for productivity growth
to pick up. And also for that reason, you know when you
forecast, we're bound to be tremendously uncertain. And, as
the Governor says, it's our biggest single uncertainty,
probably, over the forecast.
 I do take some encouragement from the work we've done
over the last three months, if only at the margin, that it's
reasonable to expect some growth, i.e. some pick-up in
growth and productivity over the next two or three years.
One, because of the importance we think of these
compositional effects, which are likely to be temporary, and
also I think there are some signs, if only tentative signs, of
the increased churn in labour markets and also increased
business formation, that might aid the kind of reallocation
that the Governor was referring to.
 Now these are no guarantees at all that productivity growth
will pick up, but they make me at least take a little
encouragement, and you know, I think it's reasonable to
expect, therefore, some acceleration in productivity over the
forecast period. 
Page 9
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
Chris Giles, Financial Times: Just to go on from productivity, I think roughly this will be the
thirtieth Inflation Report in a row where the Bank of England
has been disappointed with past productivity performance
and then expected it to recover in the future. You know,
there is the definition of insanity as expecting the same thing
to happen again and again. What evidence is there that
you're right this time, and what is the consequence that you
might be wrong?
Mark Carney: Let me start with the second, and then I'll go back to the
relatively sane Dr Broadbent.
 I think the consequence - there's a couple of consequences
you can anticipate. One is it goes ultimately to living
standards, slower growth in living standards over time for
everyone in this economy.
 In terms of monetary policy, in an economy where we've had,
as you know, a very large labour supply shock, but that
labour supply shock's increasingly being used up. We think
that spare capacity in the labour market, as I said in my
opening comments, will be used up within the next year. The
pace of growth and supply will be largely - not exclusively -
but largely determined by productivity growth. And unless
we get a one-to-one mapping of demand to supply, which is
unlikely to happen, it could have a consequence for the
timing of rate changes in order to deliver the inflation target.
 Now, it's not clear as you move farther out the forecast
horizon, it will have a material impact - it will have an impact
on the ultimate path of rates, but it would tend to dampen
the ultimate path of rates, but it could have an implication for
the timing. But, Ben -
Ben Broadbent: I mean, the sane person of course would look not just at the
last six or seven years, but the last hundred or so, during 
Page 10
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
which productivity growth has been reasonably steady in
most advanced economies. And the same person would also
take account of the fact that it's not untypical to see slower
productivity growth after financial crises, and this was a very
large one.
 So it has been very difficult, and we've sort of adjusted slowly
to the reality. When you say what can we point to, I'll just
mention what I said earlier. We don't have a complete
understanding of why this happened, but I think there are
some reasons to believe that - put it this way - positive
growth of productivity over the next three years is more likely
than negative productivity growth, and that's what the
forecast implies.
 So it's a difficult judgement, but I think it would be - if I can
put it this way - wronger to look only at the last six or seven
years as a guide to the future than to look at a longer period
of time, and ask yourself what might be considered normal,
once the effects of the financial crisis have ebbed away.
Ben Chu, The Independent: On the global bond market sell-off, which has been quite
violent in recent weeks and has actually intensified since the
Inflation Report was put to bed, I understand. You implied
from your opening remarks and subsequent remarks that you
seem relatively sanguine about that, that you think this a
kind of natural price correction of a market that got ahead of
itself. How confident are you about that analysis? And have
I got that analysis right that that's your view?
Mark Carney: Well, I think I'm going to stick largely to what I said and to
what the MPC discussed, which is that we observed that there
had been, over the course of the past year, quite a marked
flattening of the longer end of advanced economy bond yield
curves. And in terms of fundamentals, it was not entirely
clear why that had been the case; so it's not entirely
surprising that they are moving back up. 
Page 11
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
 Now, that's not a comment on day-to-day market moves and
I think there are - in a broader context of the Bank's
responsibilities - we take close interest in terms of the nature
of market functioning - and some lessons that could be drawn
from that. But in terms of broad direction the comment isn't
much more than that. And I think that, in the environment of
a sustained global expansion, curves at the extremes that we
saw earlier this year, would unlikely be sustained in the
fullness of time.
Scott Hamilton,
Bloomberg News: Thanks for that. That was the very topic that I was going to
ask about as well. I mean is it fundamentally driven, the
bond market sell-off, or is it more technically driven?
Mark Carney: Well I mean that's a short-term question. You always have
technicals overlaying these things; you know, we try to avoid
being technical market commentators. What I would say is
that the MPC's observation was fundamentally driven, as
were my comments this morning in the opening statement.
Ed Conway, Sky News: Governor, there are lots of challenges that you've talked
about in the past facing the UK economy. Obviously we've
talked about productivity a lot of today, the housing crisis,
the current account deficit. On the basis that we have a new
government, a lot of people are focusing on the next five
years. And on the basis that everyone likes a good list, what
would be the top three challenges that are facing the UK
economy, you know the government, but also just monetary
policy over that next five years, would you say, if you had to
narrow them down to three, if possible?
Mark Carney: So I heard you say - what are the top three challenges for the
MPC given that it's monetary policy [laughter] within the
remit of the MPC. Look, you know, our foremost challenge is 
Page 12
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
to chart the path for monetary policy that returns inflation to
target in a timely fashion and keeps it there.
 So as I said in the opening comments, you know we have no
inflation at present. There's a good chance that in the near
term inflation will dip slightly below zero before picking up
notably towards the end of the year, but picking up notably
towards the end of the year is not the same as inflation going
back to 2%. And so we do have to chart the path appropriate
to do that. And we have to chart a part in the context of a
global economy where there is divergent growth, divergent
monetary policy, increased exchange rate volatility. So we
have to manage that in an appropriate fashion.
 In doing so, there are a couple of broader challenges for the
UK, I would say three broader challenges for the UK, which
will have some influence in the short, and certainly have
more profound influences in the medium term for the
country's economic prospects.
 They include fiscal policy, the stance of fiscal policy and the
timing of that, which to - I'll just refer to my earlier answers
in terms of how we address that.
 Productivity, fundamental we all know that that is the
determinant of longer-term living standards, and the
productivity performance has been poor. We're looking at -
we're making a judgement about the pace of, to some extent,
a cyclical upturn, but that is not a trend change in the
productivity prospects of the country. That will be
determined by monetary policy; it will be determined by
others.
 And just to be clear the Bank's responsibilities, whether it's
price stability, or financial stability, or a well-functioning
financial system, those are just foundations for productivity
growth. They're not - you need to have all those things, but 
Page 13
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
they aren't the real determinants of long-term productivity
growth.
 And I would say on the third broad challenge where we are
engaged is to ensure that we have a resilient financial system
that conducts its business with integrity, that is open, that is
innovative and we continue to work to deliver that. We've
made a lot of progress, but that work isn't done, isn't
completed. And what needs to happen is some stocktake and
potentially some adjustment to the various measures that
have been put in place, actual and perspective, to ensure that
they are self-reinforcing to accomplish those goals.
Phil Aldrick, The Times: There have been 49 rate cuts across the world so far this
year, which looks awfully like competitive devaluation. At the
same time, UK sterling has been rising; I think it's at a seven
year high on the basket of currencies. And you've warned
that this is potentially disinflationary, can have an impact on
core inflation and therefore your decisions. So at what point
does the currency become too strongly valued or feeds into
your decisions on the projected path of rate cuts or rate rises,
rather?
Mark Carney: Well I'll take the last bit of your question which is on the
projected path of rates, the appropriate path of rates, it's
relevant. It is relevant for the policy horizon. The experience
in this economy has been that material exchange rate moves
have persistent pass-through, through to inflation, and that
that pass-through tends to extend not just to 6 and 12
months, but out to two and three year horizons, so over the
relevant policy horizon. And in a world economy where
growth is, as I said, steady not spectacular, that provides -
that reality in terms of foreign demand for UK goods and
services - that provides - that is a headwind. And it's a
headwind that can be reinforced by persistent strength of the
currency. So yes, we take it into account. 
Page 14
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
 But the best way to fully answer that question is with a
forecast, and of course the forecast takes into account not
just the level of the currency, a market path of rates, but the
factors that are determining demand and supply over the
forecast horizon. And in our forecast we do see, as you
would have noted, inflation getting back to target within the
two-year horizon, with a slight overshoot at the end of the
forecast.
Richard Barley,
Wall Street Journal: Governor, obviously we've seen a big pick-up in volatility in
bond markets in recent days. Is there any concern that
central banks, having acted to damp down volatility, are
going to find it very difficult to control the reversal of that
process? And how does the Bank think about that in terms of
its policy decision going forwards?
Mark Carney: Yes. Well, our view is that as monetary policy normalises, we
will see broad-brush increases in volatility, I'm not
commenting about volatility relative to the last few days, but
increases relative to longer moving averages that have been
prevalent during a period where the major central banks were
all at the zero lower bound. So we expected an increased in
volatility in rate markets, in FX markets, in other asset
classes. And also, as I said in response to an earlier
question, some increase in intermediation spreads, so a
combination of credit spreads and a charge for liquidity,
because financial reform has pushed liquidity risk increasingly
into private markets.
 That reality has been masked, or dampened, to use your
word, by the stance of central bank policy. But as policy
normalises in some of the major economies we expect that to
pick up; markets being markets some of that might get pulled
forward. 
Page 15
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
 It's one of the reasons, to repeat myself, it's one of the
reasons why the path of rates is expected to be more gradual
and ultimately rise to levels that are more limited. We will
learn as we go along that process. So it has been
incorporated into our thinking.
Paul Mason, Channel 4 News: It all begins to look a bit political, though, doesn't it, because
you know inflation is zero, you do nothing. Lots of people on
very low wages suddenly feel temporarily better because
prices are falling and their wages are slightly rising. The
government wins an election, you do nothing again. And you
make a claim that the MPC is acting to return inflation to the
target promptly by eliminating the slack in the economy. I
mean promptly is not two years, is it? And there's nothing
that you're doing that proactively eliminates the slack. You
take no policy action again and again. And my worry is that
it's kind of a mirror of the sort of pre-2008 days when we sat
here and said to Mervyn King, why don't you act, you're two
percentage points out from your target? And something
came along, as you know.
Mark Carney: Well, Paul what's going to come along is that the level that -
you know oil prices have dropped 40% year on year, the
calendar is going to move over, that fall in oil prices will go
away in terms of the calculation of inflation. Food prices have
dropped just under 2%; again the same thing is our
expectation. The impact of sterling starts to dissipate. Now
there could be further moves on sterling but they start to
dissipate.
 So as we get to the end of this year, inflation is not going to
be zero in our expectation, inflation is going to be above 1%,
it's going to pick up notably. And so we have to act - and so
that's why we're looking through this temporary low inflation.
 I would also say that the British people are looking through
this temporary low inflation. They're taking - they're not - 
Page 16
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
there's no sign of any behaviour that is consistent with a
view, or any concern about widespread deflation, people are
not delaying purchases - major purchases. In fact - I quoted
the consumer confidence indicators - one of the reasons why
consumer confidence is at a ten year high is people think this
is a particularly good time to make major purchases.
 So this is not a populus that's become risk adverse because
of monetary developments. They recognise the sort of "enjoy
while it lasts" point is begin incorporated. They also would
feel, I would suggest, that wages - while they're low relative
to historic averages - have begun to pick up, they've started
to firm, and the most recent data at least is broadly
consistent with that.
 So we have to set policy over the relevant policy horizon;
monetary policy doesn't have impact instantaneously. The
lags in monetary policy tend to mean around 18 months, give
or take, in terms of maximum impact and the impacts
gradually build. So we're trying to calibrate policy so that
inflation, as it goes up, in an economy where spare capacity
is increasingly being used up - 200,000 jobs created in the
last three months is just one example of that. As that spare
capacity is being used up, cost pressures are increasing.
We're calibrating policy in a way that we don't move up and
straight through that 2% inflation target.
 And in the judgement of the MPC, that means more likely
than not that we are going to be raising interest rates and
we're going to raise them, and to repeat myself, in a
relatively limited and gradual fashion. It's a question of the
timing and pace of rate increases in the judgement of the
MPC, best collective judgement of the MPC, not in terms of
providing some stimulus. We could provide stimulus,
additional stimulus, if we wanted to, but our view is that's not
necessary to have this economy move back to a more
sustainable path. 
Page 17
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
Heather Stewart: Hi, your Chief Economist, Andy Haldane, gave a speech in
March in which he suggested that rates might, or were as
likely to have to fall in the near term as rise, partly because
there was a risk that some of the factors that we've talked
about in the labour market, for example, you know increased
slack, high migration, weak bargaining power, might be
structural rather than cyclical. And I noticed that the Report
talks quite a bit about the divergence of views on the MPC.
 I wonder if you could just, we can't ask him ourselves
because he's not here, but can you tell us a little bit more
about the divergence of views and explain why you think
some of these factors we've talked about are short term and
cyclical and not structural changes?
Mark Carney: Well, I mean the convention, as you probably know, is that
we represent the MPC when we come to this press
conference. Now we - partly for reasons of your question,
but more broadly - we're changing the format as of August I
believe, when we will publish alongside this the minutes so
that we don't have to go through this theatre, but we are in
the theatre and I have to go through the theatre and respect
the format.
 Look, the judgement of the Committee is that - and we took a
comprehensive assessment of spare capacity in the economy
- if you do a bottom up estimate through the labour market
and spare capacity in firms, you end up with a number
around 0.3 at present in the second quarter. If you do
broader estimates using filters on the economy, looking at
broader price trends, wage residuals, other factors,
judgement, you end up with a higher number.
 But after a long discussion, a reasoned discussion, our
judgement is it's around a half, which is not a big number.
It's not a big number in an economy that we think is growing 
Page 18
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
above potential, and it's a degree of spare capacity that is
used up over the forecast horizon. And I think we're quite
comfortable with that assessment and quite comfortable that,
with time, these pressures will build up.
 Now there are some - let me make one last point on the
outlook for inflation - it’s in the report but just to reinforce it -
is as it was the case in February we think there's some
possibility - we all think there's some possibility - that wage
expectations could be softer for longer. In other words, the
wage bargaining process doesn’t lead to a pick-up consistent
with the fundamentals in the labour market as quickly as
would be expected.
 And I’ll simplify it just down to - people haven’t seen big
wage increases for quite some time; they get used to it; it
lasts longer. But this is an economy with unemployment
falling steadily, with the number of additional people willing to
work and even work more hours reducing steadily with time.
Heather Stewart: So that’s not your central forecast?
Mark Carney: That’s the central forecast; that is our central forecast.
Heather Stewart: The central forecast doesn’t include this idea that wage - ?
Mark Carney: Oh no, but it’s in the Fan.
Szu Chan, Daily Telegraph: Just a follow up on the previous two questions. So your
central assessment is that slack is absorbed next year. Last
year when slack was about 1% to 1.5% Charlie Bean said
you’d probably want to tighten policy before it was fully
absorbed. Does that statement still stand or do the many
moving parts of your forecast change that?
Mark Carney: You've got to look at it in the whole. Other things always
change, the persistence, the strength of headwinds change 
Page 19
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
and currency has moved a lot in the last year, other factors
have changed. You have to take that into account.
 We have a forecast with a relatively gentle market path that
brings inflation back to target within that two-year horizon,
but just within that two-year horizon.
Mike Bird, Business Insider: It’s just another question about those cuts to the productivity
forecast. In the Quarterly Bulletin last year the Bank talked
about the 12 percentage point explicable shortfall in
productivity since the crisis, and suggested about half of that
was down to these long-term persistent - things like impaired
resource allocation. I was wondering - do the cuts change
that analysis of the shortfall so far in any way?
 And just on page 25, you mentioned that the total factor
productivity has grown more slowly in the United Kingdom.
Outside of North Sea oil and the financial sector, is there any
explanation for that?
Mark Carney: Yeah, I’ll bounce to you. Sorry, I hesitated and didn’t quite
finish my answer to Szu.
 The important thing in terms of - there is no mechanical rule
between the output gap and the stance of policy. What we
have to be - one of the things we have to be careful about,
and it goes ultimately back to equilibrium, interest rate and
headwinds, is not to get into a situation where the gap is
closing, and we think the gap is going to close, there is an
adjustment of policy and then the gap doesn’t close because
there's an adjustment of policy. I mean it’s a very obvious
point. But there is a - we will determine the appropriate path
for policy but there's not going to be a mechanical link
between the two, and it would - well, I’ll leave it at that. It’s
all productivity all the time.

Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
Ben Broadbent: Yeah, I mean, you know, one of the examples of weak
productivity frankly is the frustratingly limited understanding
we have of the causes of the last few years, despite vast
amounts of effort to gain that understanding.
 One thing I’d point out with regards to, as it were, the lost
level that you referred to, is that our forecast - and it relates
partly to what Chris said earlier - I would regard in some
ways as relatively cautious. It certainly involves no catch-up
at all of that lost level. We’re forecasting simply a return and
even then only a gradual return; one that would imply a rise
in that shortfall relative to the pre-crisis trend, a gradual rise
back to pre-crisis rates of growth. In fact they don’t even
quite get there by the end of the forecast period.
 Now I said we'd put in a lot of effort and don’t have a very
complete understanding. I think we have some - we have
some - and I mentioned earlier that productivity is often
weaker after recessions characterised by financial crises. We
think we have pockets of understanding where things have
happened. As I say, we have little bits of evidence that we’ve
uncovered through the work in the last three months to
suggest that it’s reasonable to expect some pick-up in
growth.
 But as I say, in terms of the level of shortfall, we expect none
of that to be regained over this period of time at least. And
in that sense, I would regard it as a relatively cautious
prediction, albeit one that - as Chris points out - that’s been
wrong before now.
Mark Carney: A few times.
Ben Broadbent: A few times, yeah.
Catherine Boyle, CNBC: One area of the economy that seems to have been affected
by the election result already seems to have been the housing 
Page 21
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
market. I mean, you know, you can barely sort of get hold of
an estate agent in London this week because they all seem to
be out kind of selling houses or buying champagne, you
know, doing the hula, who knows.
 What kind of big price surges are we going to have to see
before that might affect your decision on rate rises?
Mark Carney: Well the - we don’t target house prices with monetary policy.
Our target is consumer price inflation. And so activity - the
influence of activity in the housing market is relevant to the
extent to which it influences broader activity and the path for
inflation.
 We’re in a situation where actually one of the reasons for a
slightly lower growth profile over the forecast, so GDP ends
up about half a percentage point lower than we had expected
in February, is less activity in housing. So housing has been
softer so, you know, we’ll take it into account if it moves. But
one thing we won’t do is swing monetary policy around from
targeting CPI inflation, which is our remit, to targeting house
prices.
Harry Daniel: Just a question back towards the MPC’s consensual view. Has
it differed from the last Inflation Report in terms of - you
have two members that were looking or on the edge really
and had pulled back from calling for a rate hike to coming
into the group? Is there, not conflicts, but are the differences
widening or is it more consensual now than the last Inflation
Report?
Mark Carney: Well it’s - again we get the details revealed in the minutes,
but why don’t I just ask Minouche to say a word in terms of
our central view of the path of policy, so you can hear it from
someone else other than me. 
Page 22
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
Minouche Shafik: I mean I think in this round, the consensus view was that the
most likely move is up not down, and I think that was a
consensus view this time, whereas as you implied, in the past
it was not so clear. So I think I would take that as an
indicator of the MPC’s current thinking.
Harry Daniel: So the whole body is moving towards more of a, you know,
central view now, as opposed to last time?
Minouche Shafik: Well, I think all I’d say is that we agreed the next move is
more likely to be up rather than down.
Harry Daniel: Yeah, okay, thank you.
Mario Blascack: Governor what about the MPC in April who suggest in the
minutes that the sterling pass-through effect to CPI will be
faster and stronger?
Mark Carney: Well you’re taxing my memory of exactly what we said in the
minutes, but I think that was a possibility as opposed to - I
mean, there is no evidence that the pass-through effect is
faster. So that we’re seeing right now - you know, that we’re
seeing that, that we’re seeing faster pass-through and
therefore the pass-through will come off more quickly.
 I would add further that since those minutes - well I’ll go
back to relative to the February Inflation Report to close of
business yesterday, we’ve seen a 4% increase in the effective
exchange rate of sterling. So even - we’ll have to try to
determine what’s happening with past pass-through but we
have some future pass-through if these types of moves
persist, which we’ll have to address.
Duncan Weldon, Newsnight: Governor, I understand you don’t want to give a running
commentary on the bond market, but you said at the start
that monetary policy remains stimulatory and that’s certainly
true. But if we look at the markets over the past month, the 
Page 23
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
past weeks, the past day, even this morning, 10-year gilt
yields are up by about 40 basis points in the last month,
sterling has moved to a seven year high trade weighted,
market expectations of the first rate rise have moved
forward. So although monetary policy remains stimulatory,
monetary conditions are less stimulatory than they were just
a month ago. How much further do these sort of moves have
to occur before that starts to materially impact your forecasts
and the MPC’s thinking?
Mark Carney: Well, Duncan, a couple of things have to happen. One it’s a
question on persistence and it’s a question of why they move,
all the other factors. So other factors in terms of foreign
demand, in terms of domestic demand, the evolution of
supply. All the things we’ve been discussing and that’s why
we do quarterly forecasts, because one wants to accumulate
changes and make an assessment at that point.
 But if you look just broadly, the broadest brush in terms of
global bond markets, even with the moves upwards, it’s only
partial retracement of moves over the course of the past
year. There's nothing magical about where rates were this
time last year, but it’s only partial retracement. But then
more broadly real interest rates are still flat to negative for
quite some time.
 So in an environment - they’re quite comfortable that as
consistent with our forecast, that the stance, the overall
stance of monetary policy, is stimulative and appropriately
so, given that there's still spare capacity in this economy and
given that there are these other headwinds that will continue
to weigh on this economy and therefore on inflation.
Jenny Scott: We’ve only got a couple of minutes left. Anyone who hasn’t
had a chance to ask a question yet?

Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
Jeremy Warner, Daily Telegraph: Governor, do you think that European policymakers are right
to be as sanguine as they seem to be about the possibility of
a Greek default and exit from the eurozone? Still over FX -
Mark Carney: Yeah, well let me say this about European - European
policymakers are making heroic efforts to avoid that situation
and they, alongside the IMF, are working very diligently,
creatively, innovatively and I would suggest relentlessly to try
to avoid that, in a way that’s sustainable and in a way that’s
appropriate. So I don’t think there's any complacency and
they’re doing that for the right reasons.
 That said - maybe this just reinforces that they’re doing this
for the right reasons - our assessment, which is embedded in
this Inflation Report, is that an intensification of the Greek
crisis would have an impact on global growth and would have
a modest impact on UK growth. But when we look at the
range of possibilities it’s a modest impact on UK growth.
 There is a slight downside skew to our growth forecast, and
that’s the product of things being quite different than they
were two, three years ago in terms of the real, the financial
linkages, the confidence linkages, the improvement in
fundamentals in core Europe, the change in the toolkit, the
enhancement of the toolkit of the ECB and the demonstrated
willingness of the ECB to use its tool. So all those factors
come together to mitigate - we think would mitigate some of
the spill-overs from what would be a very undesirable event,
but they do mitigate the ultimate impact.
 Let me just maybe finish with this on that question. We’re
not complacent about it either. We spend a tremendous
amount of time, when asked, when appropriate, to provide
perspective, to provide help, to think through, to contingency
plan, to try to move this situation forward, but our best
collective judgement in terms of the impact is embedded in
this report.

Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
William Keegan, The Observer: Mr Governor, you've talked about slow growth and slow
productivity growth but not no growth. Can one take it that
you dismiss the fears of a number of prominent economists
that we’re entering an era of secular stagnation?
Mark Carney: Well it’s a big question on which to end, because secular
stagnation means many different things to different people.
One element, one interpretation, one of the early
interpretations - and I spoke about this about a year and a
half ago - is that it is effectively talking about a liquidity trap,
which goes back to this question of the equilibrium interest
rates. I think the performance in the UK, and dare I say in
the US, is showing that the prospects of emerging from a
liquidity trap, a combination of policies over years has created
that prospect of emerging from a liquidity trap.
 The other sort of common parlance and I think the spirit of
your question of secular stagnation is an era of permanently
lower potential growth, productivity growth. And that’s - I
would distinguish that from what we’re talking about in terms
of the path of monetary policy and the relevant horizon for
monetary policy. When we speak of headwinds against this
economy, which weigh down on the equilibrium interest rate,
they’re distinct from a question of - in the medium term is the
consequence of a variety of factors going to mean that the
world economy is just going to grow at a slower rate for quite
some time because ultimately total factor productivity and
other productivity is not going to grow at the same rate?
 I would say the jury is very much out on that. My personal
view is that - is twofold. One, I'm sceptical of that, in the
fullness of time, I'm sceptical of that for many reasons, but
one of them is just the nature of broader scientific progress
and ultimately the mapping of those developments whether
it’s in nanotechnology, biotechnology, genomics and on and 
Page 26
Inflation Report Q&A - 13.5.15
on and on - the mapping of that to ultimate discoveries that
can be put into place.
 But then much more fundamentally, you have a series of
countries, the UK included, that are not at the productive
frontier. We still have a fairly large level gap that we can
make up over time, relative to the most productive
economies. So even if those most productive economies stop
coming up with new ideas and ways to move things forward,
we’ve got a period of catch up that, even in the longer term,
could keep us busy for quite some time, and with the right
suite of policies can improve productivity growth materially.
Thank you.
Jenny Scott: Thanks very much everyone.
